I'm Mao Dabing ("Great Soldier" Mao)



My parents threw me out when I was a kid



I came to the city to look for a job



I tried everything



Now I have a job delivering water



I love movies



Aside from food and rent...



...I spent all my money on movies



Each ticket costs three or four days' pay



I like action movies best of all



The more bloodthirsty, the better



I can see myself as the movie hero



But most movies are too short



They end just when I'm getting into them



So I go to the weekend all-night shows



Four movies, non-stop



It's like spending the whole night dreaming



This is an okay job



The boss gives each of us a bike



Dunno why people don't drink tap water



Is it poisonous?



They prefer bottled water



Just as well they do...



Keeps me in work!



Hi!



Hi!



Hi!



Thank you



Thank you



Thanks a lot



I make twenty deliveries a day



That's five or six hundred a month



But I don't know the customers



They mostly ignore me



Good things happen in movies,
not in my life



But one day when I'd finished work...



I was rushing to catch the latest release



And something terrible happened



Something I never could have imag ined



He's coming round



What's going on?



Do you recall what happened?



Do I recall?



Yeah, well...



I was on my bike, going to see a movie



And I ran into this stack of bricks



I fell off my bike



And just as I was picking myself up...



...some girl picked up a brick...



...and hit me!



Nothing wrong with his memory



I think she was in a white dress



Do you know her?



No, I don't



Then why did she hit you?



I wish I knew



What's your work unit?



I work for a company, delivering water



Officer, my... my bike?



It's a write-off



Oh, no!



Why did you hit him?



You won't say, will you?



What an attitude!



Xiao, please step outside



She is so obstinate!



Hasn't said a single word



Xiao, don't be impatient



You're new to this, take it easy



Don't lose your temper



It's you! You!



Why did you hit me?



Don't play dumb, look at me!



Recognize me?



You've nothing against me!



Why did you hit me?



See? You cracked my head open!



What made you do it?



Stop acting dumb, okay?



Listen, I've lost my job



And I gotta pay for the bike



So you owe me



Do you hear me? Why are you crying?



I didn't hit you, you hit me!



What's with you?



Are you writing?



There's no need



I've worked it out already



Doctor's bill, sick pay...



Compensation for the shock...



Let's call it... RMB 500



What?



You want me to feed your fishes?



Why should I?



What're you doing?



Don't pick on me!



There's no such thing as a free lunch



And you don't get hit for nothing either



My injury was a motiveless crime



But it got me into this really weird room



This place is like a tiny cinema



Now I hope she doesn't come back
any time soon



Then I can stay here for a while



I still have no idea
why she hit me with that brick



I don't even know her!



It beats me



But I can't shake the memory of her eyes



I got the feeling she'd seen a lot...



"If my life..."



If my life were a movie...



...I'd be the only one watching it



I wanted to record my memories...



...as if they were a movie



It'll be like seeing the ones I loved



Remembering how they looked...



Hearing their familiar voices...



"Italian film director Antonioni..."



"...in his documentary about China..."



The woman speaking is my mother



Everyone in this small town
is jealous of her



She doesn't need to get dirty
working down the mine



She stays in the studio
broadcasting news reports



Daren, is there a movie tonight?



'The Red Lantern' at 7:00 p.m.



Let's go home to eat...



...and then come back to watch the movie



"That ends today's broadcast"



"Until tomorrow!"



My mother's ultimate dream...



...was to be like the singer Zhou Xuan



And become a movie star



But at that time...



...Zhou Xuan's movies were banned



Part of the struggle against capitalism



Just like any beautiful young woman...



...in her best years, my mother...



...fell dangerously in love



Excellent!



What's so excellent?



Think she's well cast as Li Tiemei?



She's like the kind of singer...



...they used to have in restaurants



I'd go so far as to call her
counter-revolutionary



The Cultural Troupe liked my mother



They planned to train her
to a professional level



But at that critical moment...



...love brought her not only
a passionate romance...



...but also me



"The Xinua News Agency reports..."



"President Nixon and his wife..."



"...are invited to a cultural performance
tonight"



"They'll see the modern revolutionary
opera..."



"...Red Detachment of Women"



"Premier Zhou Enlai will accompany
the president and his wife..."



"...to watch the performance"



"Also present will be officials from..."



"...the State Department..."



By mistake, my mother put on a banned song



She narrowly escaped being branded
a 'counter-revolutionary'



One day, her lover (that's my father)
abandoned her



She was seven months' pregnant



Her plan was go somewhere far away



Give birth in secret,
and have me adopted



She thought no-one would find out



Even at that moment,
her dreams were still intact



She imagined that one day...



...she'd become the brightest of stars



Daren, what's the movie tonight?



A foreign movie!



Go home and tell everyone
to come to see it



A film from Albania...



...totally changed my mother's fate



It was called 'Victory over Death'



The leading character was
a strong and beautiful woman guerrilla



Her name was Mila Galami



Mother's plan was to leave town
after seeing the movie



In those days,
the chance to see a foreign film...



...was too rare to pass up



Xuehua, what's the matter?



Your tummy is aching?



Come and sit here



Take me home



I've two more reels to show



Hang on a while



Take me home



Xu, she has a tummy-ache



Can you take her home?



How is she?



Let me take a look



Her tummy hurts



Let me see



I think she's about to give birth!



She's about to give birth!



Come on, everyone,
let's get her to the hospital



Slowly... carry her



I'd been in mother's womb
for only seven months...



...before I was born in the outdoor theater



It was as if my arrival set off a bomb...



...which destroyed my mother's whole life



Denounce the man
who made you pregnant!



Why don't you say?



Speak up!



We're all brothers and sisters



You can speak freely



Kneel down! Kneel down!



She's always been tainted by
petit-bourgeois thought!



One time she was cast
in 'The Red Lantern' as Li Tiemei



Didn't she see herself as Scarlett O'Hara?



Are you still dreaming of
becoming a movie star?



You'd better take a good look at yourself!



Or you're digging your own grave!



My mother was treated very badly



People swore at her wherever she went



She decided she'd rather die
than live without dignity



"Please be so kind as to adopt this baby"



"She's an orphan"



What are you doing here?



Don't let your baby cry!



I'm about to start the broadcast



Get out of here!



"Attention, please!"



"Attention, please...
tonight in the outdoor cinema..."



"...a repeat screening of
a film from Albania..."



"'Victory over Death'"



That very night,
the movie was shown again



My mother decided this would be...



...the last movie she ever saw



Once it was over,
she would depart this life



But she wanted to take one last look...



...at the lovely Mila Galami



What are you doing?



- I'm sorry
- Sit here!



She's carrying a baby!



What are you doing? Let her sit down!



You shameless slut!



Don't play the innocent!



Shameless!



Why are you hitting her?



She's eyeing my husband



You filthy slut!



Don't even know
who is the bastard's father!



You dare show the brat in public!



Where's your sense of shame?



Slut!



Aren't you ashamed?



How dare you hit me!



From that night on...



...Mother stopped thinking about
leaving me to face the world alone



She wanted to go on living...



...just like the brave movie heroine



Indomitable!



She wasn't allowed to go on
acting with the troupe



Or to go on announcing the news



Instead she brought home soiled sheets
from the hospital



She worked tirelessly to get them clean



As white as the screen in the cinema



That white screen was always there
as I grew up



At that time, my idol was Pan Dongzi
in 'Shining Red Star'



Whenever we walked on the street...



...everyone stared at us



Mother always told me
to keep my head high



"Even when a thousand pairs
of eyes are staring..."



"...you don't need to feel afraid"



Uncle Pan...



Ling Ling!



Tell your Ma to bring you to see
'Little Soldier Zhang Ga' tonight



Great!



What's playing tonight?



'Little Soldier Zhang Ga'



What movie is it?



'Little Soldier Zhang Ga'



Ling Ling



Look at those witches!



Nice perms they've had



Here, Ling Ling



After the film tonight...



...I'll take you somewhere
you can have fun



What kind of fun?



It's a secret



You'll see when we get there



I'm over here!



Sit down, you're in the beam!



Xuehua, where did you
get your hair curled?



It looks great



We're watching the movie, be quiet!



Okay, shut up



I'll never understand



Those people who persecuted
my mother before...



...are now sitting beside us...



...as if nothing ever happened



Reel change! Reel change!



The projectionist's fallen asleep!



The lazybones!



You pulled my ponytail



- No, I didn't - It was you



- No, I didn't - It was you



Boy, what's going on?



Did you pull her pony tail?



Be good and watch the movie



Stop teasing the little girl



Sit down!



I'll get my dad to fix you two



Sit down!



Mama, why don't I have a dad?



You do have a dad



Where is he?



Ling Ling, your dad is over there



Is he really my dad?



I took what my mother said
completely seriously



My dad is a movie hero, Luo Jinbao



Ling Ling, come here



That's Little Ga!



Uncle Pan, what's this?



Ling Ling, don't touch that



That's the reel of film, kid



Ma, it's Pan Dongzi!



Uncle, can I watch the movie from here?



Why not?



Do you want to watch a movie every day?



Yes



I don't want to be your daughter



I have a dad



My dad is Luo Jinbao



Right, Mama?



Yes



Alright, I'll show you something nice



See, Ling Ling, here's your dad!



Mama, can I go play with dad?



Ling Ling, your dad is no ordinary dad



He is a guerrilla



His work is very hard



So he can't be like other people's dads



He can't play with you



But he's a war hero



He's the greatest of all dads!



Mama, is Uncle Pan telling the truth?



Yes, he is



Ling Ling, do you want to see
your dad every day?



Yes!



I had a dream that night



In my dream,
I walked into the world of movies



Dad!



Dad!



Ling Ling



Uncle Pan!



Although I didn't find Dad in my dream...



...Uncle Pan was always around



We often went to his work room



And he showed us movies



Come on, let's watch a movie!



Mama, who are they?



They're movie stars



Why haven't I seen them before?



I've seen their movies



Her name is Zhou Xuan



She's Mama's favorite



You know this song?



I've often heard you hum it



That's how I know it



Those times with my Mama...



...were the happiest of my childhood



I secretly made up my mind...



...to become a superstar like
Zhou Xuan when I grew up



If Mama couldn't do it, I would!



When I was in first grade at school...



...I met a horrible boy



So thick he might have been born from a rock



His name was Mao Xiaobing
("Little Soldier" Mao)



Raise it... slowly...



Bullshit!



This is your so-called 'Big Movie World'?



This is your scheme to
make a lot of money?



Not at all



I just wanted to offer something fresh



What's fresh about it?



Just the same old stuff!



Come round with your wife after dinner



See a movie!



Uncle, are you the one
who shows the movie?



Yes... I don't think I've seen you before



I just moved here,
my name is Mao Xiaobing



Uncle, will you show a movie today?



Yes, 'Railway Guerrillas'



'Railway Guerrillas'!



Uncle, is this 'Railway Guerrillas'?



Yes



Can I turn this?



Yes, slowly



That's right, do it slowly



Okay, make sure it picks up



Careful, slowly...



I'll be back in a moment



Who are you?



What are you doing?



Put that down!



Stop!



Stop running!



Give that back!



No, I won't! Leave me alone!



Give me back that film!



Stop chasing me!



I'm exhausted!



I give up! Here...



You stinker! I hate you!



Hurry, Mama



The movie's going to start



M r. Pan, sorry to be slow



We're delaying you



Don't mention it!



What are you looking at?



Try that again and I'll break the binoculars



You've repeated two classes already



If it happens again at this new school...



...I'll have to beat you to death



I've been talking to you all day



Are you listening?



Get up! Let's move!



This is our new classmate



Let's give him a big welcome



Tell your classmates your name



My name's Mao Xiaobing



I'm Chairman Mao's Little Soldier!



Quiet please, everyone



In his last school
he had to repeat two classes



Today he transfers to our school...



...and joins our class



Please give him all the help he needs



What's wrong?



Yesterday someone stole something
from Uncle Pan



It was him!



Did you steal something yesterday?



- I didn't - It was you!



It wasn't me



I saw you do it!



I swear to Teacher Huang that
I didn't steal anything



It's very bad to steal



And it's even worse to lie



We'll look into this later



Now, who'll sit next to Mao Xiaobing?



"25: Delivering a Raincoat"



"It's late at night..."



"But Premier Zhou is still hard at work..."



Teacher gave him the seat next to mine



He teaches us to "Learn from Lei Feng"...



...by treating our comrades
like the warmth of spring



But Mao Xiaobing was always
troublesome to me



He drove me crazy



What are you doing?



Hands off!



Mao Xiaobing! What are you doing?



Where are you going?



To stand outside as a punishment



Go!



Beat him up!



Beat him to death!



Don't move! Don't move!



Where are you going?



Which unit are you from?



Don't beat me!



Move! No tricks!



Commander, we caught a spy!



I'm not a spy!



What are you doing here?



I want to play with you



Let me play too, okay?



You want to play with us?



Who will you be?



I'd like to be a good guy



But you look more like a traitor



Stand up! Stand up!



In the name of the Party and the People...



...I sentence you to the firing squad!



Mao Xiaobing!



Mao Xiaobing, come here



What are you doing?



Come here



If you want to play with us...



...bring us that flower girl!



Give me back my film-strip



- I lost it - You're lying



I really lost it



Then get me another one



- Really? - Yes



Come on, then!



Commander, the Eighth Route Army
has gone



We've captured a flower girl



Good, tie her up



You can't move! Go!



Let me go! Let me go!



Where is the Eighth Route Army?



Untie me!



Mao Xiaobing, untie me right now!



Jiang Ling Ling, you'd better answer



Or they'll beat you for sure



Mao Xiaobing



- Punish her! - Yes, sir



Mao Xiaobing,
I'll tell your father about this!



He'll beat the hell out of you!



I won't hurt you any more
but don't tell my dad!



How dare you kick me!



You stay here all day!



Die of thirst! Let's go!



Untie me!



Let me go!



Ling Ling, I've come to rescue you



Promise you won't tell my dad



He'll truly beat the hell out of me



Ling Ling, did you hear me?



You go home! Don't worry...



I'll deal with him later!



You little wretch!



Always causing trouble!



I'll teach you!



Come here!



More trouble every day!



I'll teach you, you little bastard!



Stop, damn you!



Don't play tricks with me!



Uncle, don't beat him!



Uncle, open the door!



Why are you still here?



Uncle, please stop beating him



I have to teach him a lesson



How dare you run away?



Come back!



Stay away if you dare!



I'll kill you if you come back!



Mao Xiaobing...



Mao Xiaobing...



Mao Xiaobing, come down



Quick, come down



Why are you following me?



You're bleeding



None of your business



Go away! I'm watching a movie



You're lying, there's no movie
in the daytime



If you don't believe me, forget it



Mao Xiaobing, you must be crazy



There isn't any movie



Don't believe me? Look!



There's nothing there



Concentrate!



'Railway Guerrillas' is on?



Mao Xiaobing told me
his binoculars worked like magic



They showed him whatever he wanted



Your dad beats you so hard



Why doesn't your Ma stop him?



She's not my mother



My real mother divorced my dad



She married someone else



She wants her new son, not me



Does it hurt?



Yes, every time he beats me...



...I think of war movies I've seen



I imagine him as a Japanese soldier...



...and myself as a Communist fighter



Then I'm not afraid any more!



That's not how it seemed,
you screamed like this!



Not like that, watch me!



"You little bastard!"



"I will beat you to death!"



"Take that!"



Don't hit me!



"You wretch!"



"You can't hide from me!"



"I will beat you to death!"



Auntie, can I stay here
for a couple of days?



My dad says he'll kill me if I go home



Mama, will you let him stay?



Alright, you can stay



So Mao Xiaobing came to stay



We played together,
watched movies together



I wish those days could last forever



Why did we have to grow up?



"The night was dark"



"The train raced down the track"



"The guerrillas managed to leap on board"



"Not a single ballet was wasted"



That's not right



"Not a single bullet"



I know



"One shot took out the foreign devil
on the footplate"



In Uncle Pan's work room...



...we found lots of movie storypicture books



So on days when no movie was shown...



...we looked at them together



We could imagine the movie



"He fired three shots in the air..."



Mao Xiaobing...



What do you want to be
when you grow up?



I want to join the army...



...to fight against the Japanese



I want to be a movie star



Then I'll able to see you on screen!



Move!



What?



- You can't sit here! - Why not?



This is my territory!



We were here first



But you can't sit here



- Let's go! - No!



I'm going even if you won't



Mao Xiaobing, come back!



Don't be scared!



Ling Ling, come over here



We can watch from somewhere else



You coward, I'm staying here!



Fetch my chair



No, I won't



Go and fetch my chair



Get up, let's go!



Where are you going?



Mao Xiaobing plays with girls!



Shameful!



Just ignore them!



We can see better up here anyway



Let me help you



I don't want your help



What's wrong?



Ignoring me?



It's really clear!



- Take a look - No



Don't be angry, take a look



"Brother"



Brother



You're crying!



You rascal!



- Do you have a brother? - No



Then I'll be your brother



You look like a traitor



That won't do for my brother



My brother should be as handsome as him



- Then give me back my binoculars
- Give it to me



Careful! Don't slip and fall!



The roof top became our secret base



Xiaobing held me tight whenever
we climbed up...



...to watch movies from up there



"We row a boat across the lake"



"The lovely white temple
is reflected by the water"



"Trees and beautiful landscapes
everywhere we look"



You were out of tune



No I wasn't, you were



Alright, it was sung very well



Nobody was out of tune



Auntie, are we going to see a movie?



Yes



Mama, which movie is it?



We'll find out when we get there



Don't push!



This is the last ticket!



Someone will get hurt!



Sold out!



No more tickets?



- No more - Not a single one



Ling Ling, Xiaobing,
there're no more tickets



But I want to see 'Street Angel'



Follow me



I couldn't get tickets, can I pay you?



Can you let us in please?



No entry without ticket



Hey, he doesn't have a ticket!



Get out! You kids, get out!



Auntie, this is the men's toilet



Hu rry, you coward!



Mama, hurry!



You two go in



I've seen this film before



I'll wait for you out here



Where's your ticket?



And yours?



You little devils! When did you sneak in?



Why are you manhandling the kids?



Hey, don't cry!



So what if we don't see it!



It was no good anyway



I thought it was a war movie



What do you know?



You're just a bumpkin



I'm not!



Let's go back and see Uncle Pan's movie



This is Zhou Xuan



She starred in 'Street Angel'



Is she good-looking?



You don't think she is?



Not as beautiful as your Ma



You're such a toady!



I mean it!



You're afraid she'll throw you out



- No - Yes



- No - Yes



Okay, okay...



What does 'Street Angel' mean?



An angel lives in heaven



Very kind, very beautiful



She comes down to earth



She's now very poor



But still very kind and beautiful



Who is it?



Who's there?



I'll see



You little wretch!



Where are you going? Let's go!



What are you doing?



I'm taking my son home



I won't go... Ma



You call her "Ma"?



You disloyal wretch!



Your mother has dumplings on the table



We're waiting for you



He can go home but you mustn't beat him



He's my son! I'm his dad!



It's none of your business



This is my house, not yours



I can do whatever I like



Who do you think you are?



Dad, I'll come home with you



Then get a move on



Mao Xiaobing... Mao Xiaobing...



After Xiaobing was taken home...



...there was a big change in my family



It scared me



I saw Mama with Uncle Pan



They're in love with each other



You can't let them fall in love



My Ma abandoned me
when she married again



And now, my dad doesn't want me either



He's sending me away tomorrow morning



Where to?



To live with my g rand-dad



Where does he live?



It takes three days on the train



So I'll never see you again



You can have these



Anyhow, I'll never be able to see movies
through them again



Mao Xiaobing!



Ma, Ma!



What is it, Ling Ling?



Xiaobing's father is sending him away



Go and talk to him



He can stay with us, can't he?



Who are you looking for?



Xiaobing's father



He's out



And Xiaobing?



He's already gone to the station



Ma, hu rry!



Ma, where's the train?



Comrade, what time is the train to Anhui?



It left an hour ago



Uncle, can you make it come back?



Little friend, if I could do that...



...the sun would come up in the west!



Mao Xiaobing, you're a bad boy!



Come back! You bad boy, come back!



Mao Xiaobing was gone



And all the joys of my childhood
went with him



Whenever I looked through the binoculars...



...I imagine I can see where he is



What's he doing?



Does he remember me?



Hey, man!



Officers



Your boss is looking for you



Wants you to pay for the bike



How's the g ir I who h it me?



You're out of luck there



She probably won't be charged



I don't want to sue her, I...



Let me finish



We have the doctor's report



She is mentally unbalanced



She's ill?



And her hearing is impaired



Oh, she...



She's effectively deaf



What happened to her?



Can I see her now?



She's in a psychiatric clinic



Where is it?



It has regulations



Patients undergoing treatment...



...are not allowed visitors



I'd just like to see her



You'd be wasting your time



She doesn't recognize anyone



Let's leave it for a day or two



If anything changes, I'll tell you



Officer, I...



She can't recognize anyone?



I never imagined that this was how...



...I'd find Ling Ling again



I didn't recognize her



She's not the Ling Ling I used to know



She was so lively back then



What happened to her after I left?



After Mao Xiaobing left...



...Mama and Uncle Pan got married



First bow! Second bow! Third bow!



Today Pan Daren and Jiang Xuehua
are celebrating their marriage



Look, everyone, isn't the bride lovely?



Today Xuehua is more beautiful
than any movie star



Thank you all!



Please eat well, drink well
and enjoy yourselves!



I'll be showing movies all evening



Kids, go out to the backyard



- This little box shows movies?
- Yes



Show us!



Daren, why not forget the movies
this evening



Just show us this new toy



- A novelty for everyone - Okay



Daren, you're the richest man in this town



And Xuehua is the prettiest woman



Yes, of course



Daren has not only married
a beautiful wife...



...he's also gained a beautiful daughter!



Two for the price of one!



No flies on him!



I'll go fetch Ling Ling



What a loudmouth!



Excuse us, please, excuse us



Let Ling Ling greet her new dad



Ling Ling, greet your dad



If you don't, your Mama won't
want you any more!



Greet him, Ling Ling



He is not my dad



My dad is Luo Jinbao



Never mind



Don't make it hard for her



Xuehua and I have prepared a song



Ling Ling, you heard this
when you were born



I hate the television



I hate its sound



I hate watching it



Now that it's here,
people have gone off movies



And one year later...



...there's another disgusting
arrival in our house



My little brother was born



Mama named him Bing Bing



Dad, Ma, quick! Come here!



Do you think our son
looks like Pan Dongzi?



He does



If he ever gets the chance
to act in a movie...



...he'll be much better than Pan Dongzi!



Come on, sing it for Mama once more



My superstar, let Mama kiss you!



My superstar! My baby!



Sister, how was my singing?



The Youth Training School
is recruiting students



I want to let Bing Bing have a go



Maybe he could become a movie actor!



Great!



Can I play with your binoculars?



No, they're mine



Bing Bing, would you like to be an actor?



You might be in a movie!



Yes!



Let Mama bring you to try out
for the school



- Do you dare to try? - Yes!



That's great, son



I want to try for the school too



You're going to go to middle school



Concentrate on your studies



Let's discuss it later



I must go!



Mama, why don't sister and I both try?



- Alright - That's wonderful!



I'd never seen the Training School
before that day



And I felt happier than I'd been for ages



It was as if they'd already let me join



Ling Ling!



Ling Ling, quick!



Mama



What're you doing here, Ma?



What's wrong? What's this?



Oh my god, an acceptance letter!



A place in Training School!



Oh, Mama!



They're offering your brother a place too



But the tuition fees are very h igh



You're about to enter middle school



So let your brother go first



You can join him later, okay?



No, I want to go!



I can go to middle school as well!



I'll be frank with you



We can't really afford...



...to pay tuition fees for both of you



Let your brother go first



Understand?



I have to go!



Ling Ling, you're the eldest



Don't be so selfish!



Look, sister, Dad bought me some fishes



I got a place in the School, didn't you?



Sister, don't be so unhappy



You can try again next time



Sister, shall we feed the fishes?



Don't bother me, leave me alone!



Bing Bing, shall we go out?



Yes, where are we going?



Sister, it's beautiful!



- You like it here? - Yes



Shall we get out?



Yes



Sister! Be quick!



Sister! Sister!



Bing Bing! Bing Bing!



Where's your little brother?



Where did you take him?



You were seen taking him on a bus



Where did you take him?



I'm asking you!



Where did you take your brother?



Sister!



You scared Mama to death!



Mama, I'm alright



Tell Mama how did you get lost?



I went out to play alone and I got lost



Really? Really?



Bing Bing hid the truth from Mama



I felt so ashamed at what I'd done



Seeing his innocent face...



...for the first time since his birth...



...I wanted to be close to him



They say the outdoor cinema
is being demolished



Is it true?



Are they going to build a factory?



Yes, it's coming down tomorrow



Tonight's will be
the last show 'The Back Alley'



You should all come if you can



Dad, are you showing a movie tonight?



Yes, do you want to come?



Yes



Fine, ask Mama to bring you after dinner



The 'Big Movie World'
will be demolished tomorrow



Now there're TV sets and
tape recorders in every home



Nobody wants to see outdoor movies
any more



Alright, you finish eating



I'll go to prepare the show



Thank you



Come and get changed



Ling Ling, what are you doing?



I want to come too



Your exam is coming up



Stay here and study



Mama, can't sister come too?



Quiet!



But it's the last show tonight!



You're entering the home straight



You can't afford to relax now



I want to go!



Ling Ling, I have no more hopes for myself



All my hopes are invested in you two



There's more to life than watching movies



Understand?



But I must go!



You have to listen to me



But I really want to go!



"Who taught you that?"



"My mother taught me when I was little"



"I was in kindergarten"



"Those childhood years were so good"



"Why do we have to grow up?"



"We grow up because we eat"



Mama locked me up at home



But my heart flew to the outdoor cinema



And I thought about Mao Xiaobing



Remembering the times...



...we watched movies from our perch



Who is it?



Open the door



Officers



What are you doing here?



Oh, I'm...



I'm feeding her fishes



Feeding her fishes?



I thought you didn't know her?



It's true, I don't...



Well, actually...



Did you lie to us?



No!



Actually I did know her
when she was young



But I only realized that yesterday



Make up your own story... go ahead!



Hey boy, don't hurry



Take your time



We just want to find out
if she has any relatives



She seems to live alone



We heard from the clinic today



Apparently she's recovering



Improving quite fast



Really?



She's explained what happened that day



Do you know why she did it?



Why?



I'll tell you



Your bike ran into a stack of bricks



And her dog was right behind them



The bricks fell and crushed her dog



The incident triggered
something in her head...



...and she hit you with a brick



I didn't see any dog



Liu, over here



There's a balcony out here



These look like mine



Yours?



Looks like it



What exactly is your relationship with her?



Has she said that she knows me?



No



What's this all about?



How are you involved?



I'm asking you



Now I get it!



Hey, where are you going?



Who do you want?



Why have you come?



I want to find out something about Ling Ling



What about her?



How did she lose her hearing?



Uncle Pan told me that he was showing...



...the last outdoor movie that night



Mama, I want to go to the toilet



I'll take you home



No, Mama, I can go alone



You stay here



- Are you sure? - Yes



Alright, take care and hu rry back



Sister, sister...



What are you doing back here?



Sister, let's watch the movie together



How did you get the key?



I told Ma I needed to use the toilet



So she gave me the key



I'll take you to a nice place



This is g reat!



We can come here every day
to watch the movies!



No, the cinema will be torn down tomorrow



Look through these



Hey, let me see



Sister, my turn



Don't snatch! I haven't finished!



Okay, all yours... I'm going



Sister, don't go! I'm...



I don't know why I was so heavy-handed



My blow left her deaf



And then she disappeared



Didrt you look for her?



We did all we could,
but we never found her



But recently someone's been
sending us money...



Husband, I'm back



This is...?



Auntie, it's me!



Where is Ling Ling now?



She's in a psychiatric clinic



A clinic?



A couple of days ago...



...my bike ran into a stack of bricks



The stack toppled and sadly killed her dog



She suffered a big shock



our dog went missing the other day...



And it was found dead in a back-alley



In all these years,
I've learned to live alone



No conversation



No sound



No communication at all



One night I was taking out the garbage...



...and I found a puppy in the bin



Someone had dumped him



I brought him home



Gave him a bath



And since he looked so smart...



...I suddenly decided to call him Bing Bing



Bing Bing stayed with me



We lived together



He's the only one who can read
my thoughts...



...and understand how I feel



But when I look through the binoculars
at my parents...



...I see only two lonely faces



I think maybe they need Bing Bing
more than I do



Who is it?



So at last I understand
what I did to Ling Ling



Although at the time
it happened I had no idea



The clinic contacted us...



...and said that we could visit Ling Ling



We were so excited



Her parents talked to the clinic



They agreed to a treat for Ling Ling



Her favorite... an outdoor movie show



Sister, look at the goldfish!



Look, sister, I have fishes too



That boy over there gave them to me



Sit down



You're welcome



Those two fishes almost died yesterday



I thought I'd overfed them



Then I realized
I needed to change the water



You see, I've already killed
your dog by accident



If I kill your fishes too...



...I wouldn't be able to face you



Sorry...



I forgot, you can't hear me



This is for you



You recognize me, right?



I was Mao Xiaobing!



Now I'm Mao Dabing



It's okay...



Brother...



What is it?



Brother, there's a movie show over there



Oh, a movie...



Ling Ling, let's watch it



Come on...



The time of day I like best is
just after sunset



That's when they put up a screen



Everyone brings their own stool



And as darkness falls...



...the movie begins



The movie begins



It takes me back to the great times
I used to have...



...with Mao Xiaobing and my parents



That was a golden age for movies



The people on screen,
their images and voices...



...brought us all together



Breathing as one... Dreaming as one
