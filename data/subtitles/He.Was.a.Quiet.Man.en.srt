00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:23,300
 (Man narrating)
 It was easier in the past.

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,567
 A man knew what it was
 to be a man.

4
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:29,133
 yöu stood up for things
 that were wrong.

5
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,267
 yöu had the right
 to do so.

6
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,200
 yöu were expected
 to do so.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,634
 The way yöu lived,

8
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,234
 the training yöu put
 yöurself through,

9
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,601
 prepared yöu for the
 inevitable confrontations,

10
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,667
 ones that could end
 in dismemberment

11
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,467
 or even death.

12
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,634
 Then something happened.

13
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:51,501
 We passed laws of decency.

14
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,300
 Lawyers became our shepherds.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,701
 And what was once a fairly
 easy thing to understand

16
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,634
 became muddled
 in the bureaucracy

17
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:00,601
 of what we call
 being civilized.

18
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,133
 A man could
 no longer stand up

19
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,234
 to the wrongs
 that were around him.

20
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:07,133
 He had to go through
 courts and lawyers

21
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,167
 and trudge through miles
 of red tape.

22
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:13,734
 Women demanded equality,
 and she got it.

23
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,434
 Not by getting
 everything the man had,

24
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,267
 but by the man
 being castrated

25
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,334
 in the form
 of order.

26
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:22,634
 I don't care what yöu say.

27
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,334
 That's not progress.

28
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,434
 It's not evolution.

29
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,534
 It's a disease,
 and it needs someone

30
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:32,601
 that understands
 what's at stake.

31
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:35,934
 Someone who can stand up
 like a real man

32
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,767
 and take action
 against injustice

33
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,667
 and unfairness
 in this world.

34
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,334
 Today.

35
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,868
 Right now.

36
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:46,367

Just do it.

49
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,934
yöu can do it.

50
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,033
Just do it.

And make sure there's
nothing missing

Friday, Maconel.
(rapping on computer)

coming into town
next weekend

64
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,234
and I was just kind of
wondering maybe

65
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:53,634
if there's any possibility
yöu could do yöur yard?

66
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,300
I'll see what I can do.

67
00:03:58,234 --> 00:04:00,200
That'd be great.
Thanks.

(Male voice)
Chickened out again,
didn't yöu?

69
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,033
I didn't chicken out.

70
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:18,767
I just didn't think
the timing was right.

71
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:21,901
(Male voice)
Oh, right.
Yeah. Uh..huh.

72
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,634
The timing again.

73
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:26,367
Hey, buddy,
I think I've heard
that one before.

74
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,300
yöu should be happy
I didn't do it today.

75
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,534
'Cause if I did,
who'd be here
to feed yöu, huh?

76
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,400
Hey, who cares
about food,

77
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,067
as long as those goddamn
bastards die, right?

78
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,767
Huh? They die.

79
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,667
Fuck 'em.

 Now, what exactly is

 yöur fear
 about these chickens?

85
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,868
 (Man #2 on radio)
 Well, the fear exactly

86
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,167
 comes from the epidemic

87
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,734
 of bird flu
 and the diseases.

88
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:27,767
 And then.. Pow! I mean,
 we could all die.

89
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,834
 Well, I think that's
 just a bit extreme.

Why? yöu won't be able

Look, I am not going

00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,701
Hey, that's mine.
Put it down.

Come on.
What's it do?

111
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,100
Give it back.
Put it down.

112
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,934
Maybe it turns on his brain.
Give it back.

Give it back.
That's mine!

Blow up the entire world!

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,267
Give it back.
Give it back.

116
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,133
Let it go.

I catch yöu looking at me
like that again,

137
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,567
I'm taking it upstairs.

138
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,901
yöu know, they have rules
to protect women

139
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,601
from men like yöu!

140
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,767

yöu are so lucky
yöu didn't go home.

143
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:58,868
I wasn't going home.

144
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,334
Then where were yöu?

145
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,100
I told yöu I wanted
that list by 5.

146
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,267
That's why I brought them
up to yöur office,

147
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,734
but yöu weren't there.

148
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,667
Of course
I wasn't there.

149
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,667
I was down here
looking for yöu.

150
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:16,100
I thought yöu wanted me
to deliver them.

151
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,901
yöu thought.

152
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,701
yöu thought?

153
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:21,367
Give me this.

154
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,167
yöu didn't
staple it?

155
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,601
I used a paper clip.

156
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,367
Well, that was
really smart,
wasn't it?

157
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,534
Hey, Harp.
Shelby wants yöu in
on this conference call.

158
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:31,667
Okay.

159
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,801
Staple those together

160
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:35,434
and wait in yöur cube
until I get back.

161
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,167
We're not done
with this.

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,467
 There comes a time

163
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,200
 when the diseased
 and the weak

164
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,534
 must be sacrificed

165
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:54,067

166
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,534

00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,334
number six...

176
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,334
Just do it.

177
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:24,901
Just do it.

178
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,300
Just do it.

179
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,834
Oh, shit.

180
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Maconel!

181
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,400
I told that drone
not to leave.

182
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,868
Hey, anybody seen Maconel?

183
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:55,934
(gunshots,
women screaming)

184
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:19,834
Coleman?

185
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:22,934
Maconel.

186
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,167
Ralf, look
at what yöu did.

187
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,100
Yeah.

188
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,200
How did it feel?

189
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,400
Satisfying.

190
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,234
Christ.
Coleman?

191
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,634
Shit.
Shit.

192
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:51,701
(siren wailing
in distance)

193
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,334
I think that's
yöur cue to leave.

194
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,000
(scoffs)
yöu don't kill
this many people

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,801
and simply walk away.

196
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:58,901
No trial.
(gun clicks)

197
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:02,667
No trial.

198
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,167
(loading gun)

199
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, my God,
it's Vanessa.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,734
Vanessa?

201
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,567
I thought it was
that Paula bitch.

202
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,234
It's a common mistake.

203
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:16,400
I liked Vanessa.

204
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,701
She has a good smile.

205
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:19,701
Great smile.

206
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,801
She could light up a room
with that thing.

207
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,601
She's alive.
Vanessa's still alive.

208
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,634
Hey. Whoa.
What are yöu doing?

209
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,501
I thought yöu liked her.
That's why I wanna put her
out of her misery.

210
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:33,767
How do yöu know
she's in misery?

211
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,701
Believe me,
it is better this way.

212
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:38,467
Wait. Don't yöu need
that last bullet
for yöurself?

213
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,200
Don't be telling me
how to do this, Maconel.

214
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,934
It's only because
yöu're lamer than I am,

215
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,467
I haven't blown yöu away
at this point.

216
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,434
Excuse me,
but in as much
as we may have

217
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,167
the same feelings
about these people,

218
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,901
I'm not half as lame
as yöu are.

219
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,067
Oh, no?

220
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,734
Then yöu tell me
what yöu'd call a man

221
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,267
who's stupid enough
to piss off a maniac

222
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,868
with a fucking
loaded gun.

223
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,067
I'd call him
a maniac...

224
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,367
with his own fucking
loaded gun.

225
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,300
Ha.

226
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:10,868
That was six.

227
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
(Vanessa whimpering)

228
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,467
(sobbing)

229
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:31,801
Vanessa.

230
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,133
It's okay.

231
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:39,901
yöu're gonna make it.

232
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,300
(whimpering)

233
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,467
Let me see that smile.

234
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,801
Come on.

235
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:48,234
Come on,
yöu can do it.

236
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,434
There yöu go.

237
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,167
It really does
light up a room.

238
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,334
It's okay.
(whimpering)

239
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,734
They're coming.
They're coming.
It's okay.

240
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,434
It's okay.

241
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,167
It's okay.
(whimpers)

242
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,200
 (Woman on TV)
 The five that were killed
 were all employees

243
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,801
 of Advanced Dynamic Devices,

244
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,300
 but it's not apparent
 if they were targeted
 specifically

245
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,033
 or if they were just
 at the wrong place
 at the wrong time.

246
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:21,434
 Since the gunman,
 Ralf Coleman,

247
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,267
 died at the scene,
 we may never know.

248
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:26,033
 Jessica Light reports from
 the gunman's neighborhood
 in Crestview.

249
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,000
 Jessica?
 Hi, I'm Jessica Light.

250
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,434
 I'm here
 on a typical day

251
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:30,634
 in a typical
 suburban neighborhood

252
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,200
 hearing the same
 typical question

253
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,167
 after one of these
 tragic events.

254
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,868
 How could this
 have happened here?

255
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:38,033
 So tell me,

256
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,934
 what was
 Ralf Coleman like?

257
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:42,167
 He always seemed
 like such a nice guy.

258
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,133
 Yeah, he pretty much
 kept to himself.

259
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,334
 He was such a quiet man.

260
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,000
 (Woman on TV)
 Tragic as this event is,

261
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,634
 we're hearing that
 it could have been even worse

262
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,467
 if it weren't for
 the actions of one man,

263
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,200
 a man who was
 apparently unafraid

264
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,534
 to stand up
 to a violent world

265
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:56,667
 and just say,

266
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,934
 "No, I'm not
 taking it anymore".

267
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,734
(Fish)
Timing not right again?

268
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,367
For yöur information,

269
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,400
I did pull
the trigger today.

270
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,701
(Fish)
No shit.

271
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,300
Then what are yöu
doing here...

272
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,601
alive?

273
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:10,834
(cap clatters)

274
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,367
It's a long story.

275
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,634
Well, where the hell
are we going?

276
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,133
Talk to me.
Some other time.

277
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,334
Well, at least tell us

278
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,267
if those fucking bastards

279
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,300
are dead.

280
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,234
Those fucking bastards
are dead.

281
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,667
All right.
(fish cheering)

282
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,033
So when are yöu leaving
for Fiji?

283
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,300
Well, not for..
We have two weeks
next month.

284
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,701
Oh, wonderful.
Yeah.

285
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,033
How'd yöur wife..

286
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,767
Yeah, we're bringing
a nanny, so, I mean...

287
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,367
(continues, indistinct)

288
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,000
(knocking on door)

289
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,734
Hello, Mr. Maconel.
My name is Derrick Miles.

290
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:47,501
I wonder if I might ask
yöu a few questions
about what happened at IDT.

291
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,767
I'm with The Herald.
How did yöu get
 my name?

292
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,934
They said they wouldn't
give out my name.
Come on, Mr. Maconel,

293
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,467
yöu can't keep something
like this a secret.

294
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,868
yöu're an
honest to God hero.

295
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:57,334
I only killed one man.
Yeah, but yöu killed
the right man.

296
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:58,767
(vehicles approaching)

297
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,634
Look, do yöu think
we could continue
this conversation inside?

298
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,434
(tires screeching)
No.

299
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,534
(Men chattering)
Please, yöu'd make it
so much easier on yöurself

300
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:05,868
if yöu just tell
yöur story to one person.

301
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,033
It's called an exclusive.

302
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,634
yöu're not coming
into my house.

303
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,801
Please, Mr. Maconel,
let me in before
these vultures

304
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,100
twist yöur life
all out of proportion.
No!

305
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,000
(knocking on door)

306
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,801
(Man)
Mr. Maconel,
please, sir!

307
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:19,067
(crowd chattering)

308
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,601
(knocking on door)

309
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,834
Go away!

310
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:23,968
Go away!

311
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:29,267
(pounding on door,
chattering)

312
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,601
(Man)
We're here from
Channel 5 News...

313
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,968
(knocking on door)
(Woman)
Mr. Maconel!

314
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,634
Welcome
to our world, Bob.

315
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,801
(gasps)
 (Man on TV)
 And we are back

316
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,467
 with Ernest Williams,

317
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,701
 chicken farmer..

318
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,667
 (Man #2 on TV)
 Ernesto.
(grunts)

319
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,234
 (Man on TV)
 Ernesto. Ernesto Williams.

320
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:20,834
 Okay, and can I call yöu
 chicken farmer?

321
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:21,934
 (continues indistinct)

322
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,501
(gasps)

323
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:27,734
Oh...

324
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:49,901
Oh, fish.

325
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,067
There went our 15 minutes.

326
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,767
Bob?

327
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,567
Hi.

328
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,734
yöu know how
I was telling yöu
my company was coming in?

329
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,567
Is my lawn
bothering yöu again?

330
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,467
No, no, no, no, no.

331
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,501
Actually,
I was wondering,

332
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,133
since we're having
a small

333
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,334
Christmas barbeque
this weekend,

334
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,601
that maybe yöu'd like
to stop by.

335
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,200
It'd be nice to get
to know our new neighbor.

336
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,367
I've lived here
five years.

337
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,634
Oh, my,
how time flies.

338
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,467
(bell dings)

339
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,200
(Man)
There he is.
There's the man.

340
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,767
(Woman)
Our champ.

341
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,267
(Man)
Way to go, Bob.

342
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,501
Well done, Maconel.

343
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,801
(crowd chattering, cheering)

344
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,767
Hey, there he is!
Hey, Bob.

345
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,567
No, Mr. Maconel.

346
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,100
yöu don't work here anymore.

347
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,200
Come on.

348
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,801
Have I been fired?

349
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,100
(crowd laughs)

350
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,400
No. Come on.

351
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,868
Where are we going?

352
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:00,234
All the way.

353
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,734
yöu know, I just think
it's so great what yöu did.

354
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,334
Now maniacs will think twice
before going crazy.

355
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,300
(bell dings)

356
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,734
He's waiting for yöu,
Mr. Maconel.

357
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,400
It's right through
those doors.

358
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,801
(Woman scatting)

359
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,501
Oh, yöu can go right in,
Mr. Maconel.

360
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,200
Right through
those doors.

361
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,067
There he is.
Come on in, Bob.

362
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,501
I am so glad
to finally meet yöu.

363
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,701
Can.. Can I get yöu anything?

364
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,734
Something to drink?
A Pepsi or something?

365
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,968
Oh, Bob,
this is Maurice Gregory.

366
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,968
I brought Maurice in
to help the employees

367
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:27,367
work through their anxiety

368
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,701
during the healing process.

369
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,367
Maurice is a good man
and a gifted psychiatrist.

370
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,934
Psychiatrist?
Grief counselor.

371
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,801
Here, have a seat.

372
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,667
Have my seat.
(chuckles)

373
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,200
Sit down, sit down.

374
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,367
A lot of people asked
about yöu at the eulogy.

375
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,968
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I wanted to..

376
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,701
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
yöu don't have
to explain yöurself.

377
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,300
No, I'm sure this
has been a little bit
overwhelming to yöu.

378
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
It has.

379
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
But yöu've gotta
understand,

380
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,534
It takes a very
rare individual

381
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,801
to keep his head

382
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,133
and then take action

383
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,701
in the face
of certain death.

384
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:07,767
I'm a veteran.

385
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,534
I've had my scrapes,
let me tell yöu.

386
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,200
But I knew
who my enemy was.

387
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,734
I knew what I was getting
into on the way in.

388
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,567
These days...

389
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,367
it can come
from anywhere...

390
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,567
at any time...

391
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,033
from anyone.

392
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,667
That's true.

393
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,501
Forgive my morbid
curiosity,

394
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,767
but did yöu actually
see it happen?

395
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,534
I saw...

396
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,868
bodies hit the floor.

397
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,234
Jesus.

398
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,667
How did yöu manage
to not get shot?

399
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,767
Well, I was...

400
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:39,901
(clears throat)

401
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:41,801
I was... I dropped
a paper clip,

402
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,567
so I was already
on the floor.

403
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, my God.

404
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,767
Can yöu imagine that?
A paper clip saved his life.

405
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,234
But then yöu saw
yöur fellow workers dying
right in front of yöur eyes.

406
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:53,801
It must have made yöu
feel terrible.

407
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,601
That was a really
stupid thing to say.

408
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,901
Of course
yöu felt terrible.

409
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,901
What am I thinking?
What else are yöu gonna feel?

410
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:04,267
But then yöu
pulled it together.

411
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,701
Right?

412
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,434
And yöu, um...

413
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:09,968
And, uh...

414
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:13,467
And, well,
here we are.

415
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:16,000
All right, enough of this
depressing conversation.

416
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,434
I'm sure that yöu
and Maurice

417
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,300
will hash out
that nightmare later.

418
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,334
Right now I want yöu
to come with me.
Come on.

419
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,234
Bob, come on.

420
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,467
I pride myself
on recognizing potential,

421
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:31,968
and as tragic
as this event has been,

422
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,901
it's opened my eyes
to a real talent

423
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:36,501
that's been going to waste
right beneath my nose.

424
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,033
I'm glad I met yöu.
Me?

425
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,567
And don't try to tell me
yöu're satisfied

426
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,000
with yöur present
position here.

427
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,133
Yeah.
I know, I know.

428
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,234
yöu feel wasted,
unchallenged,

429
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,567
like yöu've got good ideas

430
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,901
but no one
will listen, right?

431
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:48,567
Come on,
be honest with me.

432
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,934
It has been a long time
since anybody asked me
what I thought.

433
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,400
Yeah, well,
those days are over,

434
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,501
because from now on,
I want to know

435
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,734
what Bob Maconel
is thinking every day.

436
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,601
Welcome to yöur new
think tank.

437
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,901
So, tell me, Bob.

438
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,834
What are yöu thinking now?

439
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm thinking how
I requested a window
for years,

440
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,801
and they said they
didn't have any left.

441
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,534
Yeah, well, a few
became available
last week.

442
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:16,734
That's right.

443
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,601
This is the office
of one of the victims.

444
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,267
My personal assistant.
Vanessa Parks?

445
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:22,567
Vanessa died?

446
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,801
No, no.

447
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,000
But she won't
be coming back.

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,901
(click tongue)
Did yöu know her?

449
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,467
Just her smile.
(helicopter approaching)

450
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,167
Yeah, she could light up
a room with that.

451
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,000
Did yöu go to visit her
at Saint Michael's?

452
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,367
No.

453
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,033
No?

454
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,434
Bob.

455
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,501
yöu've got
to go visit her.
Why?

456
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:43,400
Why? Because yöu
saved her life.

457
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,300
My God, man, the woman
is probably desperate
to thank yöu.

458
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,534
She doesn't even
know my name.

459
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:48,701
I'm not suggesting it, Bob.

460
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:49,834
I'm telling yöu.

461
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,400
Go visit her today.

462
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,067
During work hours?

463
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,567
Think of it as
yöur first assignment...

464
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,801
as Vice President
of Creative Thinking.

465
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:03,033
yöu're gonna pay me
to think?

466
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,701
It's a crazy world.

467
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:06,934
Oh, oh, oh, Bob.

468
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:09,133
When yöu, uh...
When yöu go see Vanessa,

469
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,634
I want yöu to take
this with yöu

470
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,734
and give it
to her personally.

471
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:15,067
It's just some
final work papers.

472
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:17,501
Oh, wait, Bob.

473
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,467
Why don't yöu take
yöur company car?

474
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,434
(keys clatter)

475
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:33,234
(bell dings)

476
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:39,000
Christ Almighty,
it's Maconel.

477
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,467
yöu sly dog,
playing possum
all these years.

478
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,234
Certainly had me fooled.

479
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,801
yöu know, I heard yöu
were back, but I didn't
see yöu in the pit.

480
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,234
I'm upstairs now.

481
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:48,334
And rightfully so.

482
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,868
All right,
now the big question.

483
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:51,534
How many rounds

484
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:54,434
did yöu pump into that
sick ass Coleman, huh?

485
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,667
Come on, Bob.
How many?

486
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,167
Two, three?
Five.

487
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,968
Five!

488
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,067
Pay up, sucker.

489
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,167
Hey, last time I doubt
this man's drive.

490
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,701
Oh, Bob.

491
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,100
yöu should join
our foursome.

492
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,667
We could use somebody
with yöur killer instinct

493
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,868
on the back nine.
Oh, man.

494
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:10,133
Cooper's guys would shit
if we brought him out.

495
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,734
Yeah.
(bell dings)

496
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,834
Hey, uh, happy hour
this evening.

497
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:15,934
Barney's.

498
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,567
It's right across
the street.

499
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,200
Lose the briefcase, Bob.
yöu're an executive now.

500
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:50,968
(alarm chirps)

501
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:06,367
I'd like to visit
Vanessa Parks.

502
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,367
That poor girl.

503
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,367
yöur name?

504
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,467
 Bob Maconel.

505
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:11,767
Bob Maconel?

506
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,534
 The Bob Maconel?
Yeah.

507
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,567
Honey, yöu gotta learn
to speak up.

508
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,701
My husband thinks
yöu should run for mayor.

509
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,133
(chuckles)

510
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,234
Hey, Thelma!
Thelma, answer my phones.

511
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:24,234
I gotta take
Bob Maconel here
to visit Vanessa.

512
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:28,300
We were so proud to see yöu.
It's wonderful what...

513
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,267
It's this way..
It's wonderful
what yöu did.

514
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:32,868
In fact, we have yöur picture
hanging in the cafeteria.

515
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:34,801
And of course,
everybody wants yöu
to sign it.

516
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,334
How is she?

517
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,901
yöu haven't heard?

518
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:40,133
Only that she isn't
coming back to work.

519
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,601
That bullet was right
in her spine.

520
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,968
After the swelling went down
and they removed it,

521
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:47,000
the nerves never got
back together again.

522
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,334
What are yöu saying?
She's...

523
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:49,734
(whispers)
Paralyzed.

524
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:52,334
How much?
Like, her legs?

525
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,234
Vanessa?

526
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,901
There's a visitor here
to see yöu.

527
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,901
No, no.

528
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,267
Honey,
it's Bob Maconel.

529
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,300
It's the hula man.

530
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,234
(chuckles)

531
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,634
Be right outside.

532
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,167
So, yöu're the man
that saved me.

533
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,567
I guess so.

534
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:21,701
I've been wanting so much
to meet yöu.

535
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:25,667
Can yöu come here?

536
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,701
(whispers)
Closer.

537
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:41,000
Closer.

538
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,200
(whispers)
Closer.

539
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:59,901
(gasps)

540
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,100
Son of a bitch!

541
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,834
I was a goddess.

542
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,367
Now look at me!
I can't move!

543
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,801
I can't dance!

544
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:07,968
I certainly can't
fuck now, can I?

545
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,200
(grunting)

546
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,501
yöu should have let
Coleman finish the job!

547
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,901
yöu should have let me die!

548
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:17,000
Fuck yöu!
(sobbing)

549
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,801
I should have died.

550
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,834
yöu should have
let him kill me.

551
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,267
Fuck!

552
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:27,901
I hate yöu!

553
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,200
Hey, Maconel.
(rapping on window)

554
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,300
Just in time.
We're going to Barney's.

555
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,167
Come on.
Put it in park
and shake a leg.

556
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,868
It's happy hour.
I don't want to be happy.

557
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,968
Nonsense.
Everybody wants
to be happy.

558
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,801
I have to punch in
my time card.

559
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,601
What, are yöu nuts?
Executives don't have
time cards.

560
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:06,901
Come on.
I don't drink.

561
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:09,634
Great. It saves more
for the rest of us!
Right.

562
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,868
(crowd cheering)

563
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,868
Doesn't drink, my ass.

564
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:21,767
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

565
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:22,834
Oh.

566
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:23,901
That was six.

567
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,567
(crowd cheering)

568
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,968
Bob...

569
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:35,434
I gotta admit...

570
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:37,801
that day...

571
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,000
I about shit my pants

572
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,200
when I saw Coleman
raise that gun at me.

573
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,267
Cliché as it sounds,
my whole life flashed
before my eyes,

574
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,434
and I can't say
I'm proud of much of it.

575
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,367
But yöu.. God.

576
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,901
yöu.

577
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:56,601
yöu're standing there
cool as ice...

578
00:31:56,601 --> 00:32:01,400
staring that guy down
one on one.

579
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,834
It's amazing.

580
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,534
It's fucking amazing.

581
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,467
Yeah, but there's...

582
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,901
There's one question
that's been stuck
in my brain.

583
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,901
If yöu had a gun,

584
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:18,000
why did yöu wait till
the shooting stopped
to use it?

585
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
(crowd cheering)

586
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,634
Hey, forget it.

587
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:24,400
yöu know,
the important
thing is...

588
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,767
that I didn't get
my ass blown off
that day,

589
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,801
and I know
I probably have yöu
to thank for it.

590
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,033
Uh, another round here.

591
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,467
Ugh, no six.

592
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,767
Oh, shit.
There he is.

593
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:37,834
The Mind Fucker.
(laughing)

594
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:39,467
I need to go home.

595
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,067
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey.

596
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:44,067
Oh, hey, Bob.
yöu okay?

597
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,334
Man, he's
fucked up!

598
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,267
Uh, somebody ought
to drive him home.

599
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,434
Yeah, well,
I'm in the other
direction.

600
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:54,801
I'll take him home.

601
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,767
(Paula)
Now, I hope yöu didn't

602
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,100
take what I said
last week too seriously.

603
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,033
I mean, a girl's got
to protect herself

604
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,834
from getting stuck
with a loser.

605
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,267
yöu know,

606
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,234
a guy with no future,

607
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,801
no balls.

608
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,367
It's not yöu, Bob.

609
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:16,334
I mean, everyone knows that
yöu've got a great future.

610
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,734
Now, as for the balls...

611
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,667
yöu've certainly
proven it.

612
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,434
Ugh.
yöu've got a great
big set of those.

613
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:29,868
I'd be more than honored

614
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:33,667
if yöu'd like to take
another look down my blouse.

615
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,000
Actually....

616
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,167
No!

617
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,367
Oh, fuck!

618
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:42,767
(pop)

619
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:46,200
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

620
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,100
(Man)
Hey, nice tits!

621
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,100
(honking)
Fuck yöu,
asshole! Fuck!

622
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,634
Hi.

623
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:01,868
(Fish)
Hello? Hey, Shithead.

624
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,701
Get up.

625
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,634
Wake up!

626
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,734
Christ Almighty.

627
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:12,467
The master lives.

628
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,234
Now, could yöu feed us
before we all die?

629
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:16,434
yöu'd better hurry,

630
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:19,968
Stripes is rolling
for the third time.

631
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:22,567
yöu happen to see the lady
that brought me here?

632
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,667
Don't work
that way, Bob.
(grunting)

633
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:28,334
yöu don't see it,
we don't see it.
Remember?

634
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,067
(clears throat)
Nice tits, though.

635
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:33,000
(breathing heavily)

636
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:37,234
Bob.

637
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:38,834
There he is.

638
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,601
My best
drinkin' buddy.

639
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:42,601
So, uh, Bob,

640
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:43,934
was it hot, huh?

641
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,601
Was she everything
she thinks she is?

642
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:46,901
I honestly can't say.

643
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,434
Okay, a gentleman.
(chuckling)

644
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,200
Okay.
We're going to have
to work on that.

645
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,834
Have yöu seen her?
No.

646
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,300
Not yet, but, uh,

647
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,767
I did see Mr. Shelby.
He's looking for yöu,

648
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:58,234
some important assignment

649
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,701
yöu were supposed
to take care of?

650
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:01,167
(whispering)
Yes.

651
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,667
I got to go.

652
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,667
Hey, Bob.

653
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Bob?

654
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,667
(whimpering)

655
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:16,033
(tires squealing)

656
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,467
I need to see
Vanessa Parks.

657
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,968
Oh, that poor girl,
are yöu a relative?
No.

658
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,901
Well, only relatives
are allowed in during
non visiting hours.

659
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm Bob Maconel.

660
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,667
Oh, I don't believe
yöu're here...

661
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:27,934
I know I upset her before...

662
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:30,667
I've been trying
to get a hold of yöu.
What?

663
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,868
Vanessa. She wanted
to see yöu again.

664
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:35,567
 (Woman on intercom)
 Dr. Steven Chang
 to Cardio Path Lab,

665
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,601
 Dr. Steven Chang...

666
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,801
Hi.

667
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:45,300
Can yöu close
the door, please?

668
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,000
Certainly was fast.

669
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,968
Actually, I was
coming to see yöu.

670
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:52,133
I was supposed to give
this to yöu yesterday.

671
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,033
(door closes)
It's from Mr. Shelby.

672
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm sure he would
have delivered it
himself, but uh,

673
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,601
he's been real busy
with everything
that's happened.

674
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,868
I'm sure.

675
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,501
I could open it
and read it to yöu.

676
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,400
No.

677
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:13,434
Well, where would yöu
like me to put it?

678
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,200
How about straight
up his ass?

679
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,267
Okay.

680
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:19,234
(sighing)
I'm sorry, I...

681
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:20,901
I didn't mean
to snap at yöu.

682
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:24,133
It's okay.
No, it's not.

683
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:27,367
I want to apologize
for the way I treated
yöu before.

684
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:32,067
It was completely unfair
to blame yöu for my...

685
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,567
for my condition.

686
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,100
yöu risked yöur life
to save me.

687
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,701
yöu had no idea
I'd end up like this.

688
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,367
Maybe yöu would've
acted differently

689
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:44,000
if yöu knew I'd never
be able to use another
body part again,

690
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,367
or that I'd have to rely
on people for the rest
of my life

691
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,400
to feed me and clothe me...

692
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,067
and diaper me.

693
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:55,601
yöu think yöu would have?

694
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:56,834
Would have what?

695
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:59,167
Acted differently.

696
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,334
Yes.

697
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:08,100
I knew it, I knew yöu
were a compassionate man.

698
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,167
That's why yöu're the only one
that I can ask this favor of.

699
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,767
I want yöu to finish
what Coleman started.

700
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:21,701
Bob,

701
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:24,868
I don't want
to live this way.

702
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,801
I can't live like this.

703
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:35,133
My spirit will die
a million times every day.

704
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,300
If yöu have any feelings
for me at all,

705
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,834
yöu'll help me
through it.

706
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,567
(whispering)
Please.

707
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:44,234
I can't do this anymore.

708
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,400
yöu're asking me
to end yöur life?

709
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,567
(sighing)

710
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,601
It's already over.

711
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,901
I get released

712
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:04,200
to home care
Wednesday at five.

713
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,767
If I don't see yöu then,
I.. I'll understand.

714
00:38:26,968 --> 00:38:28,400
(knocking)

715
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,701
There yöu are.
Mr. Shelby.

716
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:30,834
Sit, sit, sit.

717
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,033
So, did yöu complete
the assignment?

718
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:34,033
I delivered it
to her personally.

719
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,367
Excellent.

720
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,767
Did she say anything
when yöu told her
it was from me?

721
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,100
No.

722
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,701
Did she open it?

723
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:45,567
Vanessa's a quadriplegic.

724
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,968
She's completely paralyzed.

725
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,167
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,801
I'm, uh, just having so much
trouble accepting this.

727
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,033
I had no idea
that losing her

728
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,634
would affect the company
the way it has.

729
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:59,667
She did more than just
brighten this place up.

730
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:03,601
She did the little things
that nobody else will.

731
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:06,934
I feel a little bit
lost without her.

732
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:08,200
Well, if yöu...

733
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,601
need any help filling
in the gaps, I can try.

734
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,567
yöu wouldn't mind?

735
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,667
It might help
with my thinking.

736
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,801
All right, then.

737
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:22,434
I guess yöu could
take this over, hah.

738
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:24,868
It's my wife's latest
attempt to get published.

739
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:27,400
We need 50 copies of that
by tomorrow to send out.

740
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,334
Oh, and um, when yöu
finish with that,

741
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:34,300
could yöu pick up
these suits at Armine's?

742
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,567
They, um...

743
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:40,200
close at three.

744
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,467
Bob, Bob.

745
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:56,467
When are yöu
coming to see me?

746
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,400
I have to get
these copied.

747
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,634
Uh, can I help yöu?
I got it.

748
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,300
Hey, have yöu ever
used this machine?

749
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,567
A copier's a copier.

750
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,300
Ha, look,

751
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,901
I know yöu're the "big hero"
around here, having shot
the bad guy and all,

752
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,067
but operating the 349
isn't as easy as pointing
and pulling a trigger,

753
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,968
yöu know what
I'm saying, Bob?

754
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:19,300
These have
to be perfect,

755
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,868
they're for
Mr. Shelby himself.

756
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:23,267
I'll be gentle.

757
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,200
I hear yöu've been
looking for me.

758
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,167
Oh.

759
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:29,367
Quite a night,
wasn't it, hm?

760
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,601
What happened?
yöu don't remember?

761
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:35,767
(chuckling)
Well, I, uh,

762
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,200
I know now why yöu're
such a quiet man.

763
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,834
Why?

764
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:44,000
Because yöu
don't have much
to talk about...

765
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,300
down there.

766
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,901
(giggling)
Don't worry, baby.

767
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:51,601
(whispering)
It'll be our little secret.

768
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:54,234
(laughing)

769
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:01,701
It was supposed to be yöu.

770
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:03,968
(continues laughing)

771
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:08,033
Vanessa Parks is paralyzed
because she looks like yöu.

772
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,667
What?

773
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,167
Coleman made a mistake.

774
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,868
Okay.
(chuckling)

775
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:22,334
yöu just dissed
Paula Metzler.

776
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,267
yöu really are
a bad ass.

777
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:27,200
(Bob)
She doesn't know
how lucky she is.

778
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,100
 (Woman on television)
 The F.B.I. is now saying

779
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
 sabotage was the cause
 of that airliner
 losing its wheel,

780
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,667
 which resulted
 in 12 deaths.

781
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,934
(whispering)
Finish what
Coleman started.

782
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,367
 The F.B.I. are also
 still piecing together

783
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,701
 the possible motive
 for Ralf Coleman's
 murderous rampage at ADD,

784
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:43,801
 but have so far
 made little progress.

785
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,767
 They also refuse
 to link Coleman's actions
 to the recent discovery

786
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:50,100
 that his wife and daughter
 had died in an auto accident
 five years ago,

787
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,534
(chanting)
Finish what
Coleman started.

788
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:54,234
 saying it was
 too long ago to matter.

789
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:56,167
Listen to them.

790
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,801
Don't those
fucking assholes know

791
00:41:57,801 --> 00:42:00,334
the world
is a shitty place?

792
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:01,968
Just ask Vanessa.

793
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:04,467
Shut up!

794
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:07,467
That poor girl.

795
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:39,901
(sighing)

796
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:47,200
Ready to leave?

797
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,634
Mm..hmm.

798
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:10,667
(folk)

799
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:24,701
(chuckling)

800
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,334
How appropriate,
my old company car.

801
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:29,133
yöurs?

802
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,367
What else did Shelby
give yöu of mine?

803
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,901
yöur office.

804
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,801
I think yöur job.

805
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:39,367
Well, whatever yöu do,
don't sleep with him.

806
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,634
I won't.

807
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:48,567
Okay, let me see
how to do this.

808
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,601
All right?
Yup.

809
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,801
That's it.

810
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,634
This one around
my chest, here,

811
00:44:02,634 --> 00:44:04,200
there's this clip
in the back.

812
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,634
All right.

813
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:08,767
yöu going
to be all right,
if I do this?

814
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:14,400
(clearing throat)

815
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,133
Don't worry,
I won't feel anything
if yöu touch me.

816
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:29,567
(mumbling
indistinctly)

817
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay.

818
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,067
(grunting)

819
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,667
Uh, well, maybe..

820
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:39,868
maybe not everything.

821
00:44:39,868 --> 00:44:41,100
(both chuckling)

822
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,634
♫ I will not blink again ♪

823
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:49,300
Okay, there yöu go.

824
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,634
Okay.

825
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:56,634
♫ yöu will be sure
 as I am ♪

826
00:44:56,634 --> 00:45:02,634
♫ That yöu and I are one ♪

827
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:05,000
(sighing)

828
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,434
Now what?

829
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:08,367
Just get me
out of here.

830
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,501
(Vanessa)
I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

831
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,801
and I think
I've figured out
a way for yöu to do this

832
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:18,167
without getting
any blood on yöur hands.

833
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,501
The last thing I want
is for yöu to get into
any trouble over this.

834
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:24,234
Legally or spiritually.

835
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:26,234
And I'm not taking
any bullshit pills either.

836
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:28,701
I'm going out
the same way I came in...

837
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:31,634
dramatically.

838
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,767
There's a station
on the Red Line,

839
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,834
one where
the South Express
doesn't stop.

840
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,701
The concrete
in the waiting area
is sloped, not very much,

841
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,033
but it's smooth
all the way down.

842
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,167
So, just position me
at the top,

843
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:47,467
and when we feel
the train coming,

844
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:50,400
just let me go,
and gravity will take over.

845
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,767
What station?

846
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:57,534
Franklin Street.

847
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:59,300
The one by
the Crown Superstore?

848
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,901
Yeah.

849
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,267
Is it a busy station?

850
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:05,634
Yeah, but it clears out
at about midnight or so.

851
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,033
yöu hungry? yöu want
to get something to eat?

852
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:14,033
Are yöu asking me
to dinner, Bob?

853
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,634
I guess.

854
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:17,567
(laughing)

855
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:20,767
There's a...

856
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:22,801
Sizzler up here
a little ways.

857
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:24,968
Sizzler?

858
00:46:24,968 --> 00:46:27,200
Look, Bob, if this
is going to be
my last meal,

859
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,133
I'd like it to be
something special.

860
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:34,734
I don't get out much,
Sizzler's all I know.

861
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:39,434
Then this will be a treat
for the both of us.

862
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:43,300
Right, this way, sir,

863
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,000
we have a lovely table
for yöu, hidden away
in the back.

864
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,934
(bang)
Oh.

865
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,067
Six months I've been
trying to get a table here,

866
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:53,400
yöu've always been
too crowded?

867
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,767
Well, tonight must be
yöur lucky night.

868
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:59,267
Oh, yeah, it's amazing
what a bullet to the spine
will do for yöur luck.

869
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:02,234
I should
go out and get
some Quick Picks!

870
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:07,467
I'm sure yöu'll have
a wonderful time here
at the restaurant.

871
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,167
Here yöu are.

872
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,367
yöur waiter
will tell yöu
about the specials.

873
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,868
God, I hate snobs.

874
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,534
Then why eat here?

875
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:21,934
Because it's
supposed to be
the best in the city,

876
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:24,133
and I don't want yöu
to forget this night.

877
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,133
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

878
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:28,868
yöu're not going to chicken
out on me, are yöu, Bob?

879
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:29,968
No.

880
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:31,234
Because this will
be a wasted meal

881
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:32,434
if yöu don't go
through with it.

882
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,734
It's not a wasted meal.

883
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:36,634
Then stop looking
so goddamn sad.

884
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:38,000
Sir,

885
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,367
Madam,

886
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,167
would yöu like
to hear the specials?

887
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,634
Oh, no need, we'll take
the two most expensive
dishes on the menu.

888
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:45,033
(Waiter)
Excellent choice.

889
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:47,467
I imagine yöu'd like
a bottle of Opus One
to wash it down?

890
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:48,868
yöu read my mind.

891
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,434
I'll bring it
right over.

892
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,601
Don't worry, if yöu
really have my job,

893
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:56,400
yöu can afford it.

894
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,100
Aren't yöu going
to miss anything?

895
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,667
yöur friends,
yöur family...

896
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:03,767
Bob, how many flowers
were in my room?

897
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:06,033
I don't remember.
None.

898
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:08,634
And how many people
came to wish me well?

899
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:11,667
I don't know.
None.

900
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,267
And who came
to see me today?

901
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:14,901
The day I got
to go home?

902
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:18,534
Just me.

903
00:48:18,534 --> 00:48:20,400
Just yöu.

904
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,934
yöu're such a beautiful woman,
so full of life, yöur smile...

905
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,567
Yeah, I could light
up a room, I know,

906
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,434
it's my first
line of offense.

907
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:29,968
I don't understand.

908
00:48:29,968 --> 00:48:32,701
I'm 26 years old, Bob.
26?

909
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,400
Yeah, and I was a heartbeat
away from being Senior VP

910
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,767
at a Fortune 500
company in just
one year on the job.

911
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,801
yöu're an incredibly
educated woman...

912
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,968
No, no I'm not.

913
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:49,467
My entire extended
schooling is two years
at Valley Junior College.

914
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,868
I have a brain, Bob,
but the only reason why

915
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,601
I got to where I am
so fast is because,

916
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:55,634
one, I was a complete
knockout, and two,

917
00:48:55,634 --> 00:48:59,234
I gave the best goddamn
blow jobs in the entire state.

918
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:01,100
yöur wine.
Great.

919
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:07,200
And it didn't hurt
that I also had that whole
woman/child thing going on.

920
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,501
Men either wanted to
protect me or fuck me, so,

921
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,667
it helped me get
up the ladder,

922
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:17,133
and I did a hell of a
lot of climbing, Bob.

923
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:20,267
 More than my share.

924
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:21,734
Right.

925
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:24,367
Look, the point is,
yöu don't make any friends

926
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:25,968
stepping all over them
on the way up.

927
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:29,934
Look, enough with
this doom and gloom.

928
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:32,133
Let's see what a $300 bottle
of wine tastes like.

929
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:35,934
Me first. Here, can
yöu take this off?

930
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:47,033
Ohhh...

931
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:50,267
Okay?

932
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:51,968
Yeah.

933
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:54,033
Don't worry.

934
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,801
Ohh..

935
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:00,067
Whoo...

936
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,801
Ow, that's so
much better.

937
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:21,567
Now that I'll miss.

938
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,834
 Bon appetit.

939
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:29,167
yöu have any brothers and
sisters?
Umm...yeah....

940
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:32,400
What was yöur most personal...
I do like apple juice a lot...

941
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,200
Really? One time
at the office I was
talking shit about Paula

942
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,467
Sweet Orchard apple juice...
and she was right behind me.

943
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,534
Oh, Paula...

944
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,367
(laughing)

945
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,267
But are goldfish like cats,

946
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:44,267
where yöu can't leave food
out for them?

947
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:48,334
Pretty much.
Everyone's due for
a good hangover.

948
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:51,334
It's easier to ask
what hasn't been my most...

949
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:54,133
yöu go ahead,
I'm stuffed.

950
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:56,100
How can yöu tell?
yöu can't feel anything
below yöur neck.

951
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,834
I know my limit.

952
00:50:57,834 --> 00:51:00,234
Besides, they're
closing this place
out, I think.

953
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,467
It's only
ten o'clock.

954
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:09,701
I guess we're going to have
to try and find something else
we've never done before.

955
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:12,200

as the original

1022
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:12,234
So we rescanned, using
NMR microimaging.

1023
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:14,701
That revealed an overabundance
of progenitor cells,

1024
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:16,167

I told yöu guys to be here

1065
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:25,000
It's an emergency.
(indistinct)

(laughing)

1069
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:52,400
The big problem's
a lack of communication
between departments,

1070
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,300
but I notice there's one place
people don't have any trouble
expressing themselves,

1071
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,968
and that's by the water cooler,
so I thought if yöu put
a little miniature water cooler

1072
00:59:58,968 --> 01:00:02,834
by every phone in every office
and promote communication
between departments.

1073
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,934
That's good
thinking, Bob.

It was a great day.

1100
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,501
But it could
be perfect.

1101
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:06,367
It's not already?
(kissing)

1102
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,734
It just needs
that final touch.

1103
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:16,234
yöur finger's definitely
getting stronger.

1104
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:17,934
Take me to the couch.

1105
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:46,367
I want to satisfy
yöu, Bob.

1106
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,868
yöu have.
yöu are.

1107
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:53,100
Not intellectually,
I mean intimately.

1108
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,634
Sexually.

1109
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:57,434
All yöu have to do
is reposition me,

1110
01:02:57,434 --> 01:03:00,834
put my head over the couch,
and I'll do the rest.

1111
01:03:00,834 --> 01:03:05,133
Vanessa!
What? yöu're my
boyfriend, right?

1112
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:06,734
Come on, yöu've done
so much for me.

1113
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:09,467
Please, just let me
do this for yöu.

1114
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,934
No, no,
I don't think we should.
I don't see yöu that way.

1115
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:18,467
Well that's just it.
I want yöu to. I want
yöu to find me attractive.

1116
01:03:18,467 --> 01:03:19,934
I do.
yöu're beautiful.

1117
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,534
Not enough to
be intimate with?

1118
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:25,767
Vanessa,

1119
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:27,434
from the first moment
I saw yöu

1120
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:31,901
I wanted to be close to yöu
in every way possible.

1121
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:38,267
I fantasized about yöu

1122
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:39,834
being naked.

1123
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,367
Can I at least fulfill
that fantasy then?

1124
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,033
Please?

1125
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:52,434
(Man singing)

1126
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:54,767
Buttons, Bob?

1127
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:58,200
(giggles)

1128
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,934
It's okay.

1129
01:04:17,634 --> 01:04:19,167
There's a clasp.

1130
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:35,801
Touch them.

1131
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,367
But yöu won't
feel anything.

1132
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:41,267
I will if yöu do.

1133
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:55,701
♫ So don't yöu worry at all ♪

1134
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:04,167

1144
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:13,534
What?

1145
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,434
Take me with yöu.

1146
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:18,033
Vanessa, it's Monday.
I have to go to work.

1147
01:06:18,033 --> 01:06:20,100
I know. I want
to go with yöu.

1148
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,767
Why?

1149
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:24,367
Because, it's time to
see where it happened.

1150
01:06:25,868 --> 01:06:29,267
All those people seeing
what's happened to yöu.

1151
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:30,634
The ones that yöu said
yöu stepped on,

1152
01:06:30,634 --> 01:06:32,767
are yöu sure yöu're strong
enough to handle all that?

1153
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:39,133
I will be
if yöu're with me.

1154
01:06:46,734 --> 01:06:48,167
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1155
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:53,234
Is the lipstick
overdone?

1156
01:06:56,868 --> 01:06:58,734
No, the nurse
did a good job.

1157
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:00,067
This hair
is in the way.

1158
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,901
Let's no do this.
Not today.
No! No no no no no!

1159
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,367
When are yöu going to learn
to put yöur emotions away
and just do it?

1160
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,434
Stop! Dammit,
don't do that!

1161
01:07:20,434 --> 01:07:23,267
Don't be weak.
Come here!

1162
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:28,100
Look at me.

1163
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,701
Show some
courage, Bob.

1164
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:31,868
I need that.

1165
01:07:33,868 --> 01:07:35,767
yöu're all I got
in there.

1166
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,100
Vanessa. It's really
a shame what happened.

1167
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,300
But yöu look ravishing
as always.

1168
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:14,267
Such a tragic thing, Vanessa.
If there's anything
I can do, really.

1169
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,167
yöu okay?
Keep moving.

1170
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,033
(Vanessa)
It smells different.

1171
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:26,133
(Bob)
They started to pump
in air freshener.

1172
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:27,767
How come?

1173
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:30,067
It's supposed to
make yöu happy.

1174
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,334
It stinks.

1175
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,701
Wait, stop.

1176
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:47,167
I was filling
my water bottle.

1177
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,968
Where were yöu?

1178
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,100
I was over by the hula girl.

1179
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:02,601
Take me to where I fell.

1180
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:27,534
I heard the shots, but I didn't
see where they came from.

1181
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,467
Where was Coleman standing?

1182
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,100
He was right there.

1183
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,167
Show me.

1184
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:48,701
I wanna see.

1185
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,567
 (gunshots)

1186
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,334
What's wrong?

1187
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,901
I wish I would have
seen his eyes.

1188
01:10:35,434 --> 01:10:37,501
If yöu had,
he wouldn't have fired.

1189
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:40,367
How do yöu know?

1190
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,767
I know.

1191
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:48,300
Vanessa?

1192
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:55,567
They told me yöu were here.
I couldn't believe it.

1193
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:57,267
I wanted to see
where it happened.

1194
01:10:57,267 --> 01:10:58,767
I understand.

1195
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:05,968
I am so, so sorry
about what happened.

1196
01:11:05,968 --> 01:11:07,868
Yeah, so am I.

1197
01:11:07,868 --> 01:11:10,501
Bob. Come on. Let's go.
We're done here.

1198
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,701
yöu can move?

1199
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:16,200
I..I thought yöu were
permanently paralyzed.

1200
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,968
Yeah, so did I. I guess
we were both wrong.

1201
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:21,534
Bob.

1202
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,767
It was so good
to see yöu.

1203
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:36,033
Freak show's over.
Everyone back to work.

1204
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:53,834
That's Hawaii, definitely.
Or maybe it's Japan.

1205
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:55,834
Both would be great.

1206
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,234
God, it would be nice
to go somewhere.

1207
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:03,701
yöu're awfully
quiet tonight.

1208
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:10,234
If yöu hadn't been shot,
would yöu ever have thought
of being with me like this?

1209
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:12,701
That's kind of
a cruel question.

1210
01:12:12,701 --> 01:12:13,968
yöu wouldn't, I know.

1211
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:16,133
I didn't even
know yöu.

1212
01:12:16,133 --> 01:12:18,100
Who would yöu be
with then?

1213
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,033
What does it matter?
We're in a different world.

1214
01:12:21,033 --> 01:12:22,467
Mr. Shelby...

1215
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:28,334
Did yöu love him?

1216
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:30,133
He was married, Bob.

1217
01:12:30,133 --> 01:12:32,834
So?
So I told yöu
who I was before.

1218
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:34,734
And why I did
what I did.

1219
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:37,167
(jet roar)
Love was the last
thing on my mind.

1220
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,934
Why are we talking
about this right now?
What happened happened.

1221
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:44,667
And in this world
I'm with yöu, yöu are
the one I want to be with,

1222
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,501
and nothing's going
to change that unless
yöu want it to change.

1223
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:53,133
I don't want
anything to change.

1224
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:55,133
Then it won't.

1225
01:13:21,801 --> 01:13:23,534
Bob,

1226
01:13:23,534 --> 01:13:26,634
yöu should've told me
yöu like yöur women
submissive.

1227
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:30,167
I would have
accommodated.

1228
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:32,133
yöur day will come.

1229
01:13:38,968 --> 01:13:39,901
Hey Bob.

1230
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:44,434
What are yöu doing in here?
We need to talk.

1231
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:47,100
Don't yöu ever stop?
I have nothing to say.
I'm fine.

1232
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,767
Well, I'm not, okay?

1233
01:13:48,767 --> 01:13:52,067
I'm failing here, Bob,
and I need yöur help.

1234
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:55,567
See, I wasn't good enough
to do my job.

1235
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:57,767
And now I think something
really wrong is going to happen,

1236
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:01,267
and it's going to be my fault.
What could go wrong?

1237
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:06,000
Let me show yöu something.

1238
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,467
All right, Bob.
yöu gotta see this.

1239
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:16,067
I haven't shown this
to anybody.

1240
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:21,100
Sit down.

1241
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:37,033
Where did yöu find this?

1242
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:39,534
In the copy machine.

1243
01:14:39,534 --> 01:14:42,567
yöu see, the good thing is,
it's in the form of a question.

1244
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,601
That means whoever wrote it

1245
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,834
hasn't made up their mind
what they're going to do yet.

1246
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,367
Maybe they already have,
and they're not
going to do anything.

1247
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,901
Can we take that chance?

1248
01:14:55,501 --> 01:15:00,234
No. The person that wrote
this note is reaching out.

1249
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:01,801
He may not even know it.

1250
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:04,634
But that would be
a real tragedy

1251
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:08,701
if yöu and I didn't
try to save him.

1252
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:10,133
How can I save him?

1253
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:14,100
Help me bring him out
into the open.

1254
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,667
Otherwise, I gotta
go down to Mr. Shelby,

1255
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:23,601
initiate a company..wide
handwriting analysis

1256
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,801
and, my friend,
that's just a bitch.

1257
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:28,367
It's just a bitch.

1258
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:32,534
Oh, shit.

1259
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:35,534
(beep)
 Bob, yöu there?

1260
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:39,834
(clears throat)

1261
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:43,767
Ah. I need yöu to go
out and buy a gift.

1262
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:47,567
I wanna get something...
something really special,

1263
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:48,767
but I don't know
what's appropriate

1264
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,834
for someone
in Vanessa's condition

1265
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:55,701
I figured yöu would know
what she'd like these days,

1266
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:58,200
because I certainly
don't know.

1267
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,234
I can not get over seeing
her come in like that.

1268
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:02,934
What a brave woman.

1269
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:06,434
Here. Take the afternoon
if yöu need it.

1270
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,868
We... here.

1271
01:16:10,868 --> 01:16:12,634
What? Do yöu think
it's not enough?

1272
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,734
I don't think it's right.

1273
01:16:14,734 --> 01:16:16,601
Why not?

1274
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,934
yöu shouldn't be buying
presents for another woman.

1275
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:20,534
Vanessa is not
another woman.

1276
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,033
She happens to be a valued
and appreciated member
of the ADD team.

1277
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:25,501
Is that what yöu
tell Mrs. Shelby?

1278
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:27,868
Are yöu questioning
my fidelity?

1279
01:16:27,868 --> 01:16:30,801
Because if yöu are,
yöu are way out of line, pal!

1280
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,467
I just don't wanna see
her hurt again.

1281
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:33,934
And what are yöu?
Her protector?

1282
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,033
I care about her.

1283
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:38,534
Oh, Jesus, yöu're
in love with her.

1284
01:16:38,534 --> 01:16:41,934
(laughs)
I can't believe it.

1285
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:44,167
She's done it
to yöu too.

1286
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:47,434
Bob, that woman

1287
01:16:47,434 --> 01:16:51,133
will do anything to get a man
to give her what she needs.

1288
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:52,601
She's changed.

1289
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:55,000
Yes. She's disabled.

1290
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,667
She doesn't want
anything from me.

1291
01:16:57,667 --> 01:17:00,767
Bob, yöu're the spoon.

1292
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:03,601
Because that's what
she needs right now.

1293
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:05,567
But let me ask
yöu something.

1294
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:08,100
What happens if she starts
to wiggle more than her finger?

1295
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,234
What if she starts to move
her entire hand?

1296
01:17:10,234 --> 01:17:11,901
Or her arm?

1297
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:14,167
What happens if she
can feed herself,

1298
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,000
move herself,
take care of herself?

1299
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,234
Do yöu really think
that a woman like that

1300
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,334
is gonna choose
a man like yöu?

1301
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:24,701
I mean, honestly now.

1302
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:28,167
I...

1303
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:31,334
am not...

1304
01:17:31,334 --> 01:17:35,534
a spoon.

1305
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:54,834
There he is.
Man of the people.

1306
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:58,834
Now this thing between
yöu and Little Miss
Bottle Rocket serious?

1307
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:00,334
Don't call her that.

1308
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:02,934
I'm just saying, Bob,
yöu're at yöur peak right now.

1309
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:05,701
Great money, great car,
great friends.

1310
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:08,300
Some men wait a whole
lifetime for that.

1311
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,334
Why would yöu wanna
waste it on a gimp?

1312
01:18:10,334 --> 01:18:11,467
(grunts)

1313
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:15,000
yöu are a very
cruel man!

1314
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,267
Bob, come on. Hey.

1315
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:23,968
Forget golf on Sunday,
yöu fucking freak!

1316
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:19,067
(door creaks, slams)

1317
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:26,133
Don't touch her.

1318
01:20:27,634 --> 01:20:29,901
She was mine.

1319
01:20:29,901 --> 01:20:31,734
Well, yöu threw her away.

1320
01:20:31,734 --> 01:20:34,934
No, I didn't.
She was broken.
She was in pieces.

1321
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:37,501
She's all better now.

1322
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:38,634
She was mine.

1323
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,033
Say bye bye.

1324
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:53,200
What's this?
He's the guy
yöu're looking for.

1325
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,400
He's the one
with the problem.

1326
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:58,234
Henry from Maintenance.

1327
01:20:58,234 --> 01:21:00,200
That's yöur man.

1328
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,434
Bob, I think yöu misunderstood
what I was asking of yöu.

1329
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:05,300
No, I didn't.
yöu wanted me to find
the next Coleman,

1330
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,000
that's... that's
what I did.

1331
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,968
How did yöu
actually do this?

1332
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:10,367
I had the sense, remember?

1333
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:11,868
The sense.

1334
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:13,934
yöu know, how
I knew something was
gonna happen here.

1335
01:21:13,934 --> 01:21:16,334
How I knew to bring my gun in
the day Coleman went off.

1336
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:17,400
Right.
And yöu're right.

1337
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,868
This man is very dangerous.

1338
01:21:18,868 --> 01:21:20,367
yöu need to do something.
yöu need to get him some help,

1339
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:22,300
and yöu need to get him out
of here, just like yöu said.

1340
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,567
Bob, he's not the one.

1341
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:24,934
yöu didn't see him.
He's this tall!

1342
01:21:24,934 --> 01:21:26,100
yöu're the one, Bob.

1343
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,634
yöu're the one
that needs help.

1344
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:32,067
I'm the hero.
I shot the bad guy.

1345
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:33,801
I know.

1346
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:36,067
That's why I wanted yöu
to come to me on yöur own.

1347
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:39,334
That's why yöu're up here
on the top floor.

1348
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:40,901
yöu're wrong.

1349
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:44,100
Think about it... Vice President
of Creative Thinking?

1350
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,601
Do yöu really believe that
someone like yöu would
have a job like that?

1351
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:49,000
Someone like me?

1352
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,501
(sighs)

1353
01:21:50,501 --> 01:21:52,400
Just admit yöu're
the one, Bob,

1354
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,067
and yöu'll be
halfway home.

1355
01:21:59,434 --> 01:22:01,601
No.

1356
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:02,801
I'm not the one.

1357
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,234
I'm not the one!

1358
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm not the one!

1359
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,367
I'm not the one!
I'm not!

1360
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:11,868
Not the one!

1361
01:22:23,834 --> 01:22:25,968
No. No, no, no.

1362
01:22:25,968 --> 01:22:29,400
No!

1363
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,868
Let me through!
Let me through!

1364
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:10,133
(plane landing)

1365
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,667
(panting)

1366
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:19,801
Mr. Shelby?

1367
01:23:19,801 --> 01:23:21,133
Hello, Bob.

1368
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:22,567
What's going on?
Why is he here?

1369
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:23,701
Well...
I just came...

1370
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:24,868
I didn't ask yöu!

1371
01:23:24,868 --> 01:23:27,133
I think yöu better go.

1372
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:28,200
Are yöu sure?

1373
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,801
Yeah.

1374
01:23:30,801 --> 01:23:35,033
I, uh... I'll see yöu
tomorrow, Bob.

1375
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:37,300
Right?

1376
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,067
I didn't know that he
was coming over.

1377
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:44,667
The nurse let him in
before I could stop her.

1378
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:47,501
He's never come
over here before.
Why here? Why now?

1379
01:23:47,501 --> 01:23:48,901
He wanted to talk.

1380
01:23:48,901 --> 01:23:51,901
About what? About yöur
miraculous recovery?

1381
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:54,400
Or how... how he wants
to ask yöu back into his life.

1382
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,167
Don't do this.
Don't do what?

1383
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,834
Don't turn this into
something it's not.

1384
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,133
Don't tell me
how to feel!

1385
01:24:00,934 --> 01:24:04,100
He came over here because
he was worried about yöu.

1386
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,534
He said that yöu two
had words earlier

1387
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:08,434
and that yöu
left very upset.

1388
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:10,200
Did he tell yöu
why I was upset?

1389
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,434
How he wanted me to buy yöu
a present from him? Huh?

1390
01:24:12,434 --> 01:24:14,434
I bet he didn't tell yöu
a thing about that, did he?

1391
01:24:14,434 --> 01:24:16,601
Yeah, he did.
He also told me that
yöu harassed Paula

1392
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:18,334
and that yöu choked
Harper in the elevator.

1393
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:20,467
That's 'cause they
disrespected yöu.

1394
01:24:20,467 --> 01:24:22,467
My God! What is so wrong?

1395
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,100
I'm not the one
who has the problem!

1396
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,701
I don't need any help!
I...

1397
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:28,634
(panting)

1398
01:24:30,801 --> 01:24:32,367
Do I?

1399
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,300
Bob, everybody needs
help sometimes.

1400
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,968
There's nothing
wrong with that.

1401
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,501
Look at me.
Without yöu, I'd either
be hopeless or dead.

1402
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,567
That's because yöu
need me right now.

1403
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:42,567
What happens if yöu
start to get better?

1404
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:43,934
If yöu could feed yöurself,
clothe yöurself,

1405
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:45,667
take better
care of yöurself..

1406
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:47,667
What're yöu gonna
do with me then, huh?
Bob, please stop it.

1407
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:48,868
What're gonna
do with me then?

1408
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:50,834
yöu're gonna throw me away.
That's it.

1409
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:52,601
No, I'm not.
Listen to me.
Yes, yöu are!

1410
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:54,767
Yes, yöu are!
Sit down.
Come here.

1411
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:57,300
Sit down.
Come here.
No!

1412
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,634
I'm not coming
over there!

1413
01:25:00,634 --> 01:25:04,367
Bob. Sit down.

1414
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:08,434
Come here
and sit down, now.

1415
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:10,300
Jesus.

1416
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,868
Listen to me.

1417
01:25:12,868 --> 01:25:15,801
I didn't just find yöu
in this tragedy.

1418
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:19,734
I found myself.

1419
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:21,968
And I can tell yöu
with all honesty

1420
01:25:21,968 --> 01:25:25,467
that it doesn't matter
if I never walk again
or I can fucking fly.

1421
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:31,133
It's yöur heart
and yöur soul that
I desperately need,

1422
01:25:31,133 --> 01:25:35,434
and I'll always need.

1423
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:39,634
So yöu have a problem?
So what?

1424
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:44,300
I'm gonna help yöu
get through this.

1425
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,033
yöu just need the courage
to do the right thing.

1426
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,734
What is the right thing?

1427
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:53,834
To do what's in yöur heart.

1428
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:57,834
And yöu need the courage
to face that.

1429
01:25:57,834 --> 01:26:01,334
It's easier to find
when I'm with yöu.

1430
01:26:02,701 --> 01:26:04,701
And if yöu feel
it's slipping away,

1431
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,901
just look into my eyes...

1432
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,901
and it'll be right there.

1433
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:33,601
Do yöu love me?

1434
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:41,734
Bob...

1435
01:26:41,734 --> 01:26:46,000
that's such a foreign word
to me, yöu know that.

1436
01:26:47,434 --> 01:26:51,167
It doesn't mean
that I won't,

1437
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:54,033
I just.. I have to be
sure before I say it.

1438
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:57,734
(plane landing)

1439
01:26:57,734 --> 01:26:58,901
It doesn't matter.

1440
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:00,067
Yes, it matters.

1441
01:27:00,067 --> 01:27:01,567
It does matter, Bob!

1442
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:03,434
Please. Don't go.

1443
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:07,033
Stay with me
tonight, please.

1444
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,434
Please.

1445
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:10,200
Why?

1446
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,400
Because I'm afraid if yöu
leave feeling this way...

1447
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,534
yöu won't find
yöur way back.

1448
01:27:31,834 --> 01:27:33,801
(soft moan)

1449
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:42,801
What... what?

1450
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:47,334
 (Bob)
 So, she couldn't say it.
 So what?

1451
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:50,133
 It'll come.
 It'll happen.

1452
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:54,901
 I just have to be patient.

1453
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:57,200
 'Cause in the end,

1454
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,567
 it's all about timing.

1455
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:12,334
(groans)

1456
01:28:56,868 --> 01:29:00,234
The bitch lied.

1457
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,367
(yells)

1458
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:24,200
Excuse me, sir!

1459
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,300
Where's Shelby?

1460
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,667
He's not up here.
He's downstairs.

1461
01:29:44,501 --> 01:29:46,400
Maconel!

1462
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,567
Maconel.

1463
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:53,033
Dammit, I told that
drone not to leave.

1464
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:55,334
yöu know where
Maconel went?

1465
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,033
(office chatter)

1466
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:33,200
(Woman)
yöu see that?

1467
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,434
(Man)
Yeah.

1468
01:30:36,434 --> 01:30:38,667
He's got a gun!

1469
01:30:45,701 --> 01:30:48,300
(siren)

1470
01:30:52,067 --> 01:30:56,634
 yöu're the one, Bob.
 yöu're the one that needs help.

1471
01:31:18,968 --> 01:31:22,267
 (Bob)
 yöu may ask why
 I did what I did.

1472
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:26,634
 But what choice
 did yöu give me?

1473
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:39,167
 How else could
 I get yöur attention?

1474
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:43,267
 All I wanted was to
 exist in yöur world.

1475
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,501
 Just one person

1476
01:31:48,501 --> 01:31:52,567
 who took time
 to actually see me,

1477
01:31:54,434 --> 01:31:55,367
 who helped me...

1478
01:31:57,067 --> 01:31:59,334
 find...

1479
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:02,834
 a way out.

1480
01:32:09,934 --> 01:32:12,501
(gunshot)

1481
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:34,300
 There comes a time

1482
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,067
 when the diseased
 and the weak

1483
01:32:38,067 --> 01:32:43,133
 must be sacrificed
 in order to save the herd.

1484
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,334
 He seemed like a nice guy.

1485
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:55,767
 He was a quiet man.
