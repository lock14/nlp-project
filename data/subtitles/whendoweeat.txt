1
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,059
God's a fairy tale.

2
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,031
God's real, dude.

3
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:27,262
And for 40 bucks,
you can meet Him.

4
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,463
Ecstasy costs 20 .

5
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:33,599
Not ''Touch God X,'' man.
lt's got acid in it.

6
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,702
Nah. Just the eighth of Bud
and the bag of whiz.

7
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:38,610
You're missing out, Stuckman.

8
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,617
Hold on.

9
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:42,810
Hey, Mom.

10
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:46,150
Zeke, why are you answering?
l was gonna leave a message.

11
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,349
l'm in study hall, Mom.

12
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,982
<i>I hear a lawnmower</i>.

13
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,653
- l'm sitting near a window!
- Zeke, where are you? Don't lie.

14
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:55,094
- Mom, what do you want?
- l want you to go to the supermarket

15
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,166
on your way home
and get me two boxes of matzo.

16
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,599
No way! Not on Passover.

17
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,397
One box for my mom!

18
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,902
Mom, l don't have any money.

19
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,377
- Come home first.
- Mom.

20
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,042
Zeke, don't play with me.
l've got too much going on here.

21
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:19,645
Wha...hey... Mom...out... l...hear you...
'all me back...'ater.

22
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,380
l hate Passover.

23
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,187
Why, man? Seders are cool.

24
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:29,392
You know what?
Give me one of those tabs.

25
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,694
l'm gonna need it.

26
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,235
Zeke Stuckman.

27
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,828
Dropping ''X'' at Seder.

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,673
Dude, my mom is just
the tip of the iceberg.

29
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,072
- Listen, Peg--
- No matzo, no Seder, lra.

30
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:48,275
Have Zeke get it.

31
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,478
l can't reach him. l think l caught him
skipping class again.

32
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,612
<i>What a waste</i>.

33
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,656
- <i>Is that antacid?</i>
- No, it's just reflux, Peg.

34
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,886
- What if it isn't, lra?
- <i>It is</i>.

35
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,895
Now that--that's a chubby Santa.

36
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,396
- Thank you, Mr. Stuckman.
- Bye, Peg.

37
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:05,058
No, wait!
lra, what about the matzo?

38
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:06,863
- Can you get it?
- Uh, Mr. Stuckman?

39
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,029
Have his lordship get it.
lt's not like he's so busy.

40
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:11,868
lra, you will not
pick on Ethan tonight.

41
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:16,105
No, Peg, no. l promise.
You'll all be amazed how l treat him.

42
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,975
Also, l'll get you your matzo,
okay? Bye-bye.

43
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,140
Don't ask Nicole.
She doesn't know from matzo.

44
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,478
- Mr. Stuckman--
- What's there to know?

45
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,017
lt has to be kosher.

46
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,213
- All matzo's kosher.
- Kosher for Passover.

47
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,552
Oh, geez. What the hell...

48
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,785
Mr. Stuckman, l'm sorry.
The alarm's not inside yet.

49
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,521
l have to reconfigure
for the Chubby Santa.

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,996
- l need a prototype today, not slop.
- But it's only April!

51
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,363
- Don't tell me it's only April!
- <i>Ira?</i>

52
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,265
l've been in the Christmas business
for 30 years.

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,600
Design delay equals production delay.

54
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,730
<i>That's $10,000 a day</i>.
<i>You got that?</i>

55
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,968
- lra, please!
- What!

56
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:49,203
The pot's boiling, men working.

57
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,507
And l have to make calls
for the Autism Society,

58
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:53,980
and l want kosher matzo.

59
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,380
The matzo will be there!

60
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,420
Get it yourself.
Nicole is...working.

61
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,648
Now...

62
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,559
l'm gonna unbutton your shirt.

63
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,789
l should--do sense a focus.

64
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:09,524
Yes, you should.

65
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,567
All right.
You're touching my collar.

66
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,761
Yes.

67
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,896
l feel...heat...in my lap.

68
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,572
Very good.

69
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,169
Yeah.
Unbuttoning my top button.

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,406
Yes, l am.

71
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:30,145
- You are unbuttoning my second button.
- Yes.

72
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,220
- Sorry.
- No, that's excellent.

73
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:36,883
- Really?
- Next week,

74
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,961
we're gonna make it
to the fourth button.

75
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,929
- Nikki, you're a goddess.
- Well...

76
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,831
Okay. l want you to clean up.

77
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:47,197
l'm gonna go freshen up,

78
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:52,002
and when l get back,
we're gonna review today's session.

79
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,637
Yes!

80
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:03,176
Nikki's place.

81
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,686
<i>She'll make a man</i>
<i>out of you, I guarantee it</i>.

82
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,278
ls she there?
This is her father.

83
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,192
There's no Nikki here.

84
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,285
Son, l know what my daughter
does for a living.

85
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,627
Okay, it's okay. No, no. lt's okay.

86
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,133
Just relax, you're perfect.
lt's great.

87
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,328
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, princess</i>.

88
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,769
You should have that guy
put a testimonial on your website.

89
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:27,502
Yeah, l will, as soon as he gets over
the shock of an approving father.

90
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,339
<i>Are you okay? How's the reflux?</i>

91
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:32,380
Zeke's driving me nuts.
Your mother thinks he skipped class.

92
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,848
Dad, she's just paranoid.
ls that really what's bothering you?

93
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,612
A new Christmas ornament
just blew up.

94
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,380
Dad, you're nervous about Ethan.

95
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,978
Why should l be nervous
about Ethan?

96
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,556
l'm the one offering
that bum a lifeline.

97
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:43,818
Okay. Dad, you're gonna have
to show him the new you,

98
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,257
or he's never gonna take that job.

99
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:48,387
He needs a new him
more than l need a new me.

100
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:51,763
Honey, can you make a stop
on your way over?

101
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,029
- Dad, if l do, l'll be late.
- <i>Right</i>.

102
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,264
That'll get her started.

103
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:58,135
All right. Not to worry.

104
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,333
Big kiss. Love you.

105
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:05,244
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly,</i>
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la</i>

106
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:08,442
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly</i>

107
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,116
- Muscle Beach.
- <i>Hey, Pop. You winning?</i>

108
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:16,054
Winning is for cheaters. Hey!

109
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,387
Pop, l need a favor.
Can you get some matzo for Peggy?

110
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:23,260
lra, it's already Passover.
They'll double the price.

111
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,697
Yeah. l'll pay you back, Pop.

112
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,200
You should have planned ahead, lra.

113
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,031
l know. l didn't.

114
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,297
You gotta have a plan.

115
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,499
What happens when they poison the water
and you don't have a gas mask?

116
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,542
What are you talking about?
That doesn't make any sense.

117
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,239
Sense? Did it make sense
when the Nazis said,

118
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,144
''You look dirty,
you should take a shower.

119
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,183
Use a lot of soap.
Don't forget your towel''?

120
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:43,752
Never mind, Pop.

121
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,411
l'll call Jen.

122
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,979
<i>Men who love women</i>
<i>who'd rather check their e-mail,</i>

123
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,389
<i>when we return</i>.

124
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,821
- Stuckman.
- Jen, this is your father.

125
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,901
- Dad, we'll be on time, okay?
- l need you to pick up some matzo.

126
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,266
Oh, really? First Seder in three years,
and your wife forgot the matzo?

127
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,771
Please. Come on,
l'm trying to make this work.

128
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,774
Why don't you get one
of your real kids to get it.

129
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,436
- That's not fair.
- Every store's gonna be sold out already.

130
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:10,944
l'm sure you can find one box.

131
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,514
Commercial's ending, Dad,
l got to work.

132
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,242
Jen! We're counting on you.

133
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,375
<i>How long have you loved Amy?</i>

134
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:21,253
<i>Because as I understand it,</i>
<i>this was a passionate marriage</i>

00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,018
<i>before e-mail entered the picture</i>.

136
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,190
Room 6.

00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,497
Do you love me so much?

138
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,436
What's wrong?

139
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,771
l just want you to know that l completely
missed lunch today,

140
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,005
but l finally found
these last two boxes.

141
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,638
This old lady, she comes up
to me, and she says,

142
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:52,085
''Excuse me, l need those for Passover,''
and so l said, ''So do l, sugar.''

143
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:57,990
And she goes, ''This is the bread of affliction,
my dear. We do not eat it with sugar.''

144
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:00,392
- Oh my God.
- What's wrong?

145
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:03,021
How long have we been together?
That's your best Jewish?

146
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:37,826
lra, no.

147
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,370
l love how l look in this picture.

148
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,335
Put your father's picture
somewhere else.

149
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,306
On Passover,
my father's picture goes here.

150
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,540
Well, it's not your house, lra, it's our house,
and it's certainly not your father's.

151
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,274
Since when are you
paying the mortgage, huh?

152
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,450
l pay.
l pay.

153
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:58,850
Behold! The new me remains calm.

154
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,684
Absolutely not.

155
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,257
lf it has to go someplace...

156
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,655
Peg! That's your daughter.

157
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,488
Well, that's your son!

158
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,392
Yeah, yeah, you always say that.

159
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:15,200
Once we get in there,
there's no turning back.

160
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,896
This is our last chance.

161
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,099
All right, all right--Zeke.

162
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,506
Well, it is temporary.

163
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:28,672
Jennifer.

164
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,252
Hi, Dad, Peggy, how is every little thing?

165
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,584
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Dad.

166
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,589
So this is Grace.

167
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,625
Hi. We brought the matzo.

168
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:41,788
Yeah, we dropped it, but you don't need
all the pieces intact, do you, Peggy?

169
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:45,731
Why, it's preferable, dear.
We didn't expect you so early.

170
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,700
- Come in.
- Well, actually, we're right on time.

171
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:51,170
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!
- Pop.

172
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:52,741
Hi!

173
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,902
lt's one of the half-brothers,
and this is Grandpa!

174
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,544
Not kosher for Passover.

175
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,211
Since when do we give a crap?

176
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,418
Excuse us. Come on, come on.

177
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,490
Let go of the boy.

178
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:09,922
- Let go of me!
- You first!

179
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:14,889
l heard you skipped class.

180
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,021
That's a lie.

181
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:19,158
You move the picture of your brothers
and sister for a pizza?

182
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,758
lt's not just for pizza.

183
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,963
lt's a better spot, Pop.
Come on, go inside. Go ahead.

184
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,597
l love that picture.

185
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,573
You, hey, hey, move it,
come on, move it.

186
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,804
Table's not even set yet.
When do we eat?

187
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:33,040
We're doing everything
differently this year. Come see.

188
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,949
That's too bad, because you know last time
we all got together, it was such a treat.

189
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:45,021
My reflux is starting up again, Zeke.
Don't test me.

190
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,152
Were you hanging out
with your druggie friends?

191
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,424
- No. Are you sure it's your reflux?

192
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,796
lt's reflux! Why are you
changing the subject?

193
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,801
Because l don't want you to die.

194
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,566
Dad, l didn't skip class today.

195
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:00,904
Now, you want a sample or not?
l got stage fright.

196
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,225
Lionel!

197
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,262
l got a lot this time.

198
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:26,294
There, and the top one's the best--
seven 7 s.

199
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:31,640
Seven here, seven, seven here.

200
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:36,405
This is authentic Passover lamb,
on the spit, just like Moses had.

201
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:38,707
lt smells delicious.

202
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,975
Smells like impaled baby sheep.

203
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,917
You don't have to hope.
l know it'll turn blue.

204
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,259
Justin, Ju--Justin,
who's the senior publicist here?

205
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:55,296
Whoa. You look hot.

206
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:59,391
l don't care that it's synthetic.
lt looks like animal product.

207
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:02,198
Hello! lt's a leopard print.

208
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,999
Justin, she's not
going to wear a black suit.

209
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,479
She got Botox for this, and she's
going to wear something that shows her tits.

210
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,948
l don't care if it's a kiddie chair
because we're the only ones...

211
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:20,183
- Hey, Princess. How are you?
- Hi!

212
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,483
lt turned blue, you're clear!

213
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,387
l told you!

214
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,585
You're the master of all galaxies!

215
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,252
Grandpa, this is level 1 .

216
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:28,660
- Hi.
- Nikki!

217
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:31,756
Lionel, receipt. How are you?

218
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:35,166
Hey, give me a hug. l want to feel
your new boobs in the back of my neck.

219
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,704
Can it, Zeke.

220
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:40,367
He shouldn't direct that energy at me,
but it's perfectly normal.

221
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,068
Zeke, do you masturbate regularly?

222
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,112
What? Nikki!

223
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:48,445
lt's very important boys his age masturbate
regularly and not feel guilty about it.

224
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,540
Oh, Jesus.

225
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,641
Jen, hi!

226
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:55,588
Happy Passover!
How are you?

227
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,750
Wait, this must be Grace. Hi.

228
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,590
And l brought the matzo.
You must be Nikki.

229
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,163
Enchanted.

230
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:06,257
God, it is so great to finally see Jen
in a relationship. Look at you two.

231
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,303
Listen, if you guys ever
have bed death issues,

232
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,669
l can get the Better Sex series,
lesbian edition.

233
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,437
l mean, it's half price.
Very hot girl-on-girl action.

234
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:20,413
Well, see, thanks, but we prefer
woman-on-woman action, Nikki.

235
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,950
Me, too, sis.
Get me one of those tapes.

236
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,351
Well, this zit you met
at the door is Zeke,

237
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,513
and this is Lionel.

238
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,181
Lionel's an idiot savant.

239
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,690
- Really?
- He's not--

240
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:33,261
We're not exactly sure
what his special talent is,

241
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:36,525
but l think it has something
to do with the number 7.

242
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:38,862
- No!
- What?

243
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:42,736
We'll be eating dinner soon.

244
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:45,033
When? His lordship is late.

245
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,438
Nikki and l are starving.

246
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,568
This hasn't been koshered.

247
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:50,736
Since when are we kosher?

248
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:51,904
Yeah, since when?

249
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:53,242
Since l said so.

250
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:56,045
Don't worry, Princess,
l run the world's fastest Seder.

251
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:59,814
World's fastest Seder,
l should live so long.

252
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,480
Who the hell is that?

253
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,616
Ethan! lt's Ethan.

254
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,494
Are you out of your fucking mind?

255
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,266
Your mezuzah was no good.

256
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,775
l got you a kosher scroll.
Happy Passover, Papa.

257
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,849
Sweetheart!

258
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,080
Nikki.

259
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:34,052
Ethan. Now you're going
for the whole get-up?

260
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:36,556
The Rebbe says, " Look righteous,
feel righteous."

261
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,425
- Jennifer.
- Hey, Ethan. So this is Grace.

262
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:41,496
A.k.a. the matzo-bearer.

263
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,997
l'm sorry, l can't touch a woman
unless she's related.

264
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:46,693
What is that, like a rule or something.
That's so rude.

265
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,133
Yeah, not to mention arbitrary.

266
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,865
Leave him alone.
He's a good Jew.

267
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,304
And what, l'm a bad Jew?

268
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,740
- Ethan!
- Grandpa.

269
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,411
Oh, that's a beautiful hat.

270
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,541
But why you got to look so Jewish?

271
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,348
When the Nazis come they're going
to take the black-hats first.

272
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:10,824
You got a hell of a nerve
pounding nails into my house.

273
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:15,954
Dad, the mezuzah will protect your body
and soul, 24/7 , free of charge.

274
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:19,466
Mom, did you get the paper plates?

275
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:20,796
Paper plates?

276
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,700
ln my house?
Let me show you where they--

277
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:23,897
Hold it, hold it.

278
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,498
You think cause some moonie Rebbe
tells you to put on a Hasid suit,

279
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,273
you can take a hammer to my house,
then tell me to relax?

280
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,477
Hey, Ethan, you haven't learned
a goddamn thing since our last Seder.

281
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:41,249
There is no product, Ethan.
You're going to be in the toilet in six months!

282
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,222
That is old economy thinking, Dad.

283
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:46,556
l made more money last month,
than you made in your entire life!

284
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,289
l don't need your dinosaur advice!

285
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:49,694
Excuse me, you son of a bitch!

286
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,289
- Now you're going to call Mom a bitch?
- Get out of my house!

287
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,663
You get out of my house!

288
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,201
Dad!

289
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:00,935
Just hope you've learned
not to smash the Seder plate, Dad.

290
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,034
lt's the holiest object in the Jewish home.

291
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,636
Don't start with me, Ethan.

292
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:08,512
You got religious because
you lost all your money.

293
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:13,452
Maybe this Hasid crap
works in bankruptcy court, huh?

294
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,749
lra, you promised.

295
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,916
Yes l did, Peg.
Yes, l did.

296
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:20,359
l got news for you, Ethan.
Your life is about to change.

297
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,054
- Starting tomorrow--
- Miss Stuckman!

298
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:23,654
Yes?

299
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,428
Miss Shtuckman, tent is ready.

300
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,127
Fantastic.

301
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,705
Wait, wait, wait.
Now who the hell are you?

302
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,068
Rafi.

303
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,009
Rafi, this is my son Ethan.
He's a good Jew.

304
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:44,411
Sorry?

305
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,680
l don' t speak Hebrew.

306
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,278
Very interesting to meet you.
Miss Shtuckman.

307
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,880
l'm Mr. Shtuckman.

308
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,893
l mean Stuckman.

309
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:57,523
You better scram.
You're going to be late for your own Seder.

310
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,500
No Seder. l not religious.

311
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,900
Smart Jew. Bye-bye.

312
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,529
lra, shush.

313
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,165
Don't shush me in front of the help.

314
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:12,370
Dad, you should get that checked out.
Mom, is Vanessa inside?

315
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:13,448
She's out back.

316
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,345
You made such a beautiful tent.

317
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,516
Oh, God.

318
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,285
Why don't you just stay
and have dinner with us?

319
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:25,724
l very grateful, Miss Stuckman--

320
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:28,023
l bet you can't wait
for that shower, huh, pal?

321
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,396
Here's 20 bucks. Happy Passover.

322
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,339
l stay.

323
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,710
Great. Stay.

324
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,815
Miss Stuckman, l can have a shirt?

325
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,688
Follow me.

326
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,198
Thank you.

327
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,452
Have him pick us up
in a gas-electric hybrid limo.

328
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:30,821
And, Justin, no white limos.

329
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:33,486
Okay, then. We're a go. Bye.

330
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,227
Sorry, only immediate family.

331
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:41,291
l thought you were just going to services
and stuff. You're Hasidic?

332
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,802
lf the suit fits.

333
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,463
The suit fits nicely.

334
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,473
You look snappy too, Vanessa.

335
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:51,069
Snappy? Well, l'm wearing this
for an event later.

336
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,248
l thought l'd
have to fight you off all night.

337
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,145
No.

338
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,809
Ethan.

339
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:02,882
Too bad.
l looked up the law on cousins.

340
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,851
Ethan, we can't.

341
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:08,088
You're saying that,
but you never mean it.

342
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:12,531
Come out, you two.
We're starting.

343
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:13,931
Your mommy's calling.

344
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,503
Stop it.

345
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,371
We're cousins.

346
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:23,376
Once removed.

347
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,211
And that is why we cannot
even kiss hello.

348
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:31,184
Okay, Hasid boy.

349
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:36,758
But if l turn up the heat,
you'll take off the hat.

350
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,656
Everyone, we're starting.

351
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,387
We're already here.

352
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:41,689
Cousin!

353
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:44,061
Hi!

354
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,224
Hot dress!

355
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:49,828
You know, l wore the same one once
for a client, erectile instability,

356
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,599
and he was stable that day.

357
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,641
Hi, lra.

358
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,908
Hey! You're wearing my shirt.

359
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:03,518
Yes.

360
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:08,723
Look at all this crap.

361
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:11,987
This crap is what our ancestors
had Seders in.

362
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:15,325
We descended from monkeys.
Maybe we should have a banana Seder.

363
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,625
lra, this matters to me.

364
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:21,567
Sweetheart, did you think about
what l asked you?

365
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,199
Yeah, Mom, l believe he's going to be nice
and all, but l still can't come.

366
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,936
The house isn't kosher.

367
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:31,944
Kosher?

368
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:36,643
You want kosher?
lt'll be kosher enough for Moses.

369
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,118
So Ethan's gone religious,
l got to eat in a tepee?

370
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,449
Dad, new you?

371
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:41,522
Yeah.

372
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:45,585
Hey, Ethan, we all expected you

373
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:48,128
to come back here on your hands
and knees begging for forgiveness.

374
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,095
But you know what?
l don't need an apology.

375
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:51,665
The new me is magnanimous.

376
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,395
Matter of fact,
l am going to fix your life for you,

377
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,300
just the way l did Zeke's.

378
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,770
l got that yutz off drugs.

379
00:20:57,873 --> 00:20:59,101
What's a yutz?

380
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:02,108
lt just so happens, there's an opening
at Stuckman Ornaments.

381
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,735
Dad, you make Christmas ornaments.

382
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,805
So what? You didn't object when they paid
for your food, your clothes--

383
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,851
lra! this is not the time.

384
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:13,683
Ethan, let me ask you a question.
How do you get by?

385
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:14,949
l do whatever the Rebbe asks.

386
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,582
- How much do you get paid?
- My investments.

387
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,752
Your investments, huh?

388
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:24,696
You don't think l know that you're
taking money from your mother,

389
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,427
l.E., my money!

390
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,526
Dad. Lionel's getting upset.

391
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:33,101
l'm going to sweeten the deal.

392
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,676
l know you need to make
these adjustments in your life.

393
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:40,009
l'm going to give you your own secretary,
an office, the works.

394
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:42,481
- You start tomorrow.
- l'd be surprised.

395
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:44,313
Can we just table this,

396
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:48,913
and go in the tent,
and have a warm family Seder, okay?

397
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:51,857
You, give me the antacid.

398
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,554
Sure, take it out on the yutz.

399
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,538
Got the yutz off drugs.

400
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,207
Prick.

401
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:38,731
Prick.

402
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,602
l'm going to light your inner wick.

403
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,890
l can't sit with my legs crossed
for a whole Seder.

404
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,324
Then stretch them out, lra.
There' s room.

405
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:02,556
At least you get a camel saddle.
How do l sit up straight?

406
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:05,724
lt's Passover. You're supposed to recline.
Mom, beautiful job.

407
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,859
lt's kosher enough for Moses.

408
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,163
Could've used a heater.

409
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:12,365
Don't worry, Jenny, l got a space
blanket in the suitcase.

410
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,566
Dad.

411
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,074
Gentlemen, yarmulke.

412
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:16,769
This l know something about.

413
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,711
Nowhere in the Torah does it say
l have to wear a yarmulke.

414
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,080
lt's traditional. You shouldn't take
your hat off for nobody but God.

415
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:25,517
l thought it was because God is over you.

416
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,487
God isn't over you,
God is everywhere. We're in God.

417
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,117
The yarmulke just protects your mind,
because it separates us from the animals.

418
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,388
Okay, why don't women wear them?
Women should wear them as well.

419
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,191
- Well--
- l'll take one.

420
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:37,856
For Dad.

421
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:38,933
lra.

422
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,262
Dad.

423
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:56,512
The fastest Seder on Earth.
Page 7.

424
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:00,045
Here's the Seder plate.

425
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:02,783
Not as nice as my mother's,
but we all know what happened to that one.

426
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:06,054
Grace, the Seder plate is holy
because these foods tell our story.

427
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,423
Sort of like the Last Supper.

428
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,928
The Last Supper was a Seder.

429
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,122
Get out!

430
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:11,631
Here's the egg,
here's the bone.

431
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,462
Real lamb,
not a chicken neck.

432
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,626
The greens, the <i>charoset</i>.

433
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,601
Made with kosher wine.

434
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,865
And the horseradish.

435
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:22,933
Which l bought extra strong because
some of us have a lot to atone for.

436
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,171
- Peg, just light the damn candles.
- All right. Fine.

437
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:30,951
Blessed are you, Lord our God,

438
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,213
Ruler of the Universe,

439
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:36,085
who has sanctified us
with your commandments,

440
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:39,490
and commanded us
to kindle the festival lights.

441
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:40,618
Blessed are you--

442
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,129
Wait, Mom, there's a beautiful melody
for the holiday blessing.

443
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,391
lt goes like...
<i>Baruch Atah</i>

444
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,295
No melody.

445
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:52,098
This is Vanessa.

446
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,539
Hi sweetie. lt's my client.

447
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,702
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, no problem.

448
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:58,642
Page 7. All right, lift your cups.

449
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,510
Blessed are you, et cetera,
for the fruit of the vine,

450
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:06,416
Blessed are you,
et cetera, for the seasons of joy.

451
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:07,920
Cheers.

452
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,047
Stop. Nobody drink.

453
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:11,591
Dad, these are prayers,
they matter.

454
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:15,754
Ethan, when you have a job, a house,
a table, you can run the Seder.

455
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:16,853
Until then, just shut up.

456
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,729
Dad, these words can transform you.
You want a new you?

457
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:22,496
Do this right, and it'll happen.
Look how wise the Haggadah is.

458
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:26,005
lt says to repeat the holiday blessing.
That is a second chance to sing.

459
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,439
<i>Baruch Atah</i>

460
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:29,771
No singing.

461
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:34,008
Your brother lmre of blessed memory,
he could sing like a cantor.

462
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,343
Moving on.

463
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,543
Now, the commandment
is to drink, not sip.

464
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:38,949
Right on.

465
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:42,023
Next is hand washing.
Let's just rub them a little.

466
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,820
No! This year we wash.
That's why l got these silver bowls.

467
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,828
Naturally. Kosher Seder
means shopping for new stuff.

468
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,488
Guys, the Seder has power.

469
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,625
lt's not just about our ancestors
escaping from the Pharaoh in Egypt.

470
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:57,171
lt's about us escaping from impatience
and anger and envy,

471
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:59,240
from our own inner pharaohs.

472
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:02,742
Ethan, focus on your own inner
selfishness, and stop interrupting

473
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:05,540
lt is a commandment to interrupt.
That's how we learn.

474
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,447
lt's more of a commandment to read the
Haggadah in Hebrew like l did in my house.

475
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,075
Pop, this is my house.

476
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:13,279
What house? lt's a tent.

477
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:15,515
Why don't you do things the right way?

478
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:20,755
Your brother Dávid of blessed memory,
he could read Hebrew like a Rabbi.

479
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:26,697
Page 8. Dip the parsley in salt water.

480
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:29,793
Sorry, we need this photo op, even though
l'm playing it like they need us,

481
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:31,462
but now it turns out
there's an aquarium there,

482
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,700
and my client won't go
where there's captive fish.

483
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:36,299
- and l--
- Vanessa, dip.

484
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,400
Sorry.

485
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:41,414
Blessed are you, et cetera,
for the food of the earth. Eat.

486
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,076
Now, food is a miracle.
Really taste it.

487
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,550
lt's friggin' parsley.

488
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,747
lmagine if food didn't come from the ground.

489
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,553
lmagine if you had to climb a mountain
for it, or swim to get it.

490
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,753
Or have to earn it.
You'd starve, Ethan.

491
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,491
Dad, thank you
for putting food on our table.

492
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,759
Thank you.

493
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,925
Now that's a miracle.

494
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,629
But why have a Seder if all you're
going to do is rush through it?

495
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,500
Because that's what Jews do.
Page 9.

496
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:07,097
Here's the matzo,
here's the middle matzo.

497
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,939
l break it in half, take the larger piece,
and l wrap it. This is the <i>Afikomen</i>.

498
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,573
Later, when l go wash my hands,
the kids will hide it.

499
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:17,243
After dinner, l ransom it back from them.
We can end this whole thing.

500
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:22,984
No. The way you're supposed to do it is,
you hide it, and the kids find it.

501
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:27,653
Peg, that's your way. We all know
why we don't do it that way anymore.

502
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:29,753
l found it!
l win the prize.

503
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,628
- Yeah.
- Where did you find that, Ethan?

504
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,723
Where you hid it.

505
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:35,302
- Really?
- Yeah.

506
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,067
You little cheater.

507
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,570
- Leave the boy alone.
- l was only trying to help.

508
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:41,642
You hid it way too well.

509
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:43,105
Nobody could find it.

510
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:45,008
lt was 15 years ago.

511
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:47,172
We could switch off
who hides it each year.

512
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,271
Shut up.

513
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:49,850
You don't have to talk to him like that.

514
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,509
Page 10.

515
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,986
Dad, if you apologize to Zeke right now,
a spark of divine light would be released.

516
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,558
- Page 10.
- God's light hides in this world,

517
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,026
but when one soul reaches out to another,
a spark of that light floes back to God.

518
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:02,424
And releasing those sparks,

519
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,465
releasing those sparks is the whole
purpose of the human race.

520
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,467
Page 10--Going around the table.

521
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:11,505
Profound intellectual comments
not required.

522
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,573
Vanessa.

523
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:16,440
This is the bread of affliction.
Let all who are hungry--

524
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:19,345
Don't you dare.

525
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,182
This is Vanessa.

526
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,980
No, we don't want the aquarium moved.
We want the fish freed.

527
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:27,179
Jesus Christ.

528
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,155
From those who anger us,
we learn patience.

529
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:34,194
Okay, Ethan, l admit it.
You are a great teacher.

530
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,557
Thank you.

531
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,995
This is for real.
You really believe this garbage?

532
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:39,930
Of course it's real.
God is great.

533
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:43,003
And how do you know
this God exists?

534
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:46,801
l don't, but l want to believe
so l cultivate that desire.

535
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:50,366
And the funny thing is, the more l want God,
the more l feel God.

536
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,879
That's not Judaism,
that's New Age psychobabble.

537
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,176
lt works for me.

538
00:28:55,283 --> 00:29:00,778
No! Ethan, Judaism does not
work for you. You work for it.

539
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:06,919
Your people survived by the sweat of their
brows, not by cultivating desire.

540
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,427
Are you saying that God doesn't help?

541
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,260
Dipping into your mother's pocketbook,
that's God's help?

542
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:13,623
Problem solved.

543
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:14,702
They're freeing the fish?

544
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,634
We're very big. What did l miss?

545
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:18,467
He asked you a question, Ethan.

546
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:23,272
lf l want to give my son a gift
because l love him, l will.

547
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:27,144
Why don't you just move it forward,
and l'll check on the lamb?

548
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,613
And l don't love him?

549
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,411
l didn't send him to Stanford for three years.

550
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,146
l would have sent him for a fourth
so he could get his degree

551
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:34,721
if he hadn't bailed.

552
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:35,790
Enough already!

553
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,585
When do we eat?

554
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:41,389
You're inner pharaoh anger, Dad,
at losing the bragging rights

555
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:44,021
to a son who graduated
from Stanford.

556
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:48,262
You know what, Ethan? That is obnoxious.
This man raised you. He sacrificed for you.

557
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,269
You really want a part of this?

558
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,168
What, of your sanctimonious B.S.?

559
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:54,707
Go ahead, l'm right here.
Bring it on.

560
00:29:56,744 --> 00:30:00,942
Your career doesn't exactly
send sparks back to God

561
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,643
At least she doesn't mooch
from her parents.

562
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,378
Do you even know what l do, Ethan?

563
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:07,443
Do you?

564
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,455
l have a client.

565
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,286
His face disfigured a child today.

566
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,758
He can't even look at women
because he's so sure

567
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:16,228
that they look at him
and they see a monster.

568
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,595
So together, we follow
a 1 4-week protocol--

569
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,997
in the first seven, we just talk.

570
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:22,194
Then l start to make him feel

571
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:24,430
like an actual human being
who's worthy of love.

572
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,269
Do you have any idea
what that means to him? Do you?

573
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,708
- For a price!
- So what? Okay?

574
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:33,144
Doctors make money,
therapists make money.

575
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,182
We all make money
helping people, Ethan.

576
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:38,446
Soon l'm gonna be helping
a lot more people making more money.

577
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:40,145
l'm not gonna be ashamed then, either.

578
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,782
What are you gonna do, hire other
sex surrogates and go public?

579
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:46,383
No, l'm not! l am launching

580
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:51,124
a remotely controlled
cyber-sexual device for the home-bound.

581
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:53,325
You're gonna be rich.

582
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:57,131
Yeah, l know, because
all of those people in those chat rooms,

583
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:58,705
typing with one hand,

584
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,934
Sexologizer 2.0 could be huge.

585
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,910
There's so many one-handed
people in the world?

586
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:08,972
l got to tell you, l don't recall
Sexologizer 1 .0

587
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,607
lt was my partner's idea

588
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:13,983
because people will think
that we've already sold millions.

589
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,646
Who's ''we''?

590
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,058
lt's confidential at this juncture.

591
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:24,063
You're backing a cyber company?

592
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:28,033
Real people, real products,
not like your new economy paradigm.

593
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,866
lt's not enough Nicole's a sex worker?

594
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,439
Now you're her pimp?

595
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,407
This will allow her to transition
from surrogate to entrepreneur.

596
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,001
Surrogate? Entrepreneur?

597
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:40,979
She has sex for money!

598
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:44,540
My God, Mom, like you're so perfect!

599
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,517
You're bringing your big gigolo
here to Seder.

600
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:49,385
You're parading him around
in front of your husband.

601
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,926
Do you see how your
little princess speaks to me?

602
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:56,190
lf the shoe fits, Peg.

603
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:59,323
You allow girl speak
to Miss Stuckman like this?

604
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,425
Why don't you just scram, pig?

605
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,935
Pig?

606
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:04,629
This is a kosher Seder.

607
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:07,765
You insult the wrong man, Stuckman.

608
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:11,637
Oh, my gosh.

609
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:14,544
Make apology to Miss Stuckman and me.

610
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:18,449
- Get away from me!
- Make apology, Stuckman.

611
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:20,612
Stop it. Lionel's getting upset.

612
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,417
lra, stand up to him like a man.

613
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,587
Dad did it again!

614
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,653
You hit me with most holiest object
in house, you son of bitch.

615
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:35,232
lt's his heart!

616
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:37,804
Oh, my Daddy! Oh, God!

617
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:40,237
Let Grace through. She is a nurse!

618
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,673
l do laser hair removal.

619
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:47,547
ls it a heart attack?

620
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:50,447
l told him to make that appointment!

621
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,452
l can't tell. His pulse feels okay.
ls he on any medication?

622
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,488
No, he hasn't seen the doctor yet.

623
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:57,823
l don't know what's wrong.

624
00:32:57,925 --> 00:32:58,983
l drugged him.

625
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,993
lra, can you see my eyes?

626
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:02,460
What did you just say?

627
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,791
l said l drugged Dad!

628
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,325
You what?

629
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:14,033
l slipped a tab of Ecstacy
into his antacid.

630
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:18,374
lt's really good stuff.
Should give him a new perspective.

631
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,743
Oh, my God.

632
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:26,715
You little bastard.

633
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:34,019
You gave me your goddamn drugs?

634
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:37,461
l'm gonna give you some goddamn misery!

635
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:45,768
- lt burns!
- Eat it!

636
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:50,904
Guys, l think Dad's okay now.

637
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,153
lt's all right.

638
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:06,192
lt's all right.

639
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,558
ln the camps, horseradish
was like ice cream.

640
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:11,461
lt's all right, Miss Stuckman.

641
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:14,330
lt's a big family Seder.
lt's normal.

642
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:17,268
lt's not all right.
His pupils aren't responding.

643
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:20,033
My pupils aren't responding?

644
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,701
lra, you'll be fine.
The pupil thing is normal.

645
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,744
What do you know?
You're not the nurse.

646
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,813
lra, listen to me.

647
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:33,250
You'll roll for a few hours,
and then you'll be fine.

648
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:38,348
The only thing that can turn those hours
into a bad experience is fear.

649
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,757
Look at me, lra.

650
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:43,922
There's nothing to fear.
Do you understand?

651
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:45,589
Are you a druggie, too?

652
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,691
l'm a celebrity publicist.

653
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:50,100
l know how to handle a drug overdose.

654
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:52,035
What? l overdosed?

655
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,938
No, not with one tab.

656
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:57,533
Vanessa, you're not gonna
leave me, right?

657
00:34:57,645 --> 00:35:01,741
Absolutely not.
Let me explain to you what rolling is.

658
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,081
lt's like a roller coaster--
up, down, up again,

659
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,624
Touchy, feely, connected.

660
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:20,363
This is Vanessa.

661
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,936
They got Jennifer Lopez?

662
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,699
They don't need us.

663
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,241
- Vanessa, wait.
- Oh, my God. l'm sorry.

664
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,276
You said you weren't gonna leave.

665
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,952
Better buckle up, Dad.

666
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,850
- l wish l lived on your planet.
- Seven dwarfs.

667
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,950
You don't get upset unless we do.

668
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,791
Mom doesn't spit every time
you come in a room.

669
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,200
Nympho daughter, druggie son.

670
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,068
Another Seder ruined.

671
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:01,004
Peggy, l could die here.

672
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:02,473
lra, you're not going to die.

673
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,204
What do you know?
You're a hair plucker.

674
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,303
Welcome to the family, Grace.

675
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:10,116
Okay, bathroom break.

676
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,184
Right, right.

677
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:21,318
Okay. Shoot, l'm losing signal.
l'm about to lose you.

678
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:30,003
They have J-Lo now.
They don't have to release the fish.

679
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,334
l'm sure it's a four-star aquarium.

680
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,774
Look, l'll get you in the picture
with her, l promise.

681
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:39,711
No, not the fish, J-Lo!

682
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:41,577
Hello!

683
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:48,144
l hate A-minus celebrities.

684
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,248
Hate fuels the sinful impulse.

685
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:53,983
lsn't that lust?

686
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:57,188
Lust, too.

687
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,166
Ethan, you're sinning right now.

688
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:02,736
l'm not doing anything.

689
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:04,771
You're leering at me.

690
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:06,897
Merely admiring.

691
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:10,569
God created animals in ascending order.
He made woman last.

692
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:13,272
You're holy.

693
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:16,179
Ethan, you're lusting.

694
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:19,185
Fine. l'll look away.

695
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,050
Here, let me help you.

696
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,731
Why don't you just look into my eyes?

697
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:38,396
Or...you can look down...

698
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,400
if you want to.

699
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,752
l don't want to.

700
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:58,882
Now you're lying and lusting.

701
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,835
Grounded?

702
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:12,599
No, your punishment's
gonna be a work of art.

703
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,765
Masterpiece.

704
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,638
Wow, Mom and Dad on the same page.

705
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:18,234
You insolent little--

706
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:20,814
l told you, don't hit the boy.

707
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,473
You think l hit Dávid or lmre?

708
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:24,983
- You hit me.
- You deserved it.

709
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:27,919
This is awesome.

710
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:29,319
What are you looking at?

711
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:32,421
Can l tell you something?
lt's freezing in here.

712
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:33,959
Look at me, l'm freezing.

713
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,325
l'll get a space blanket from the suitcase.

714
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,331
Thank you, Grandpa,
but really, l'd like a sweater.

715
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:40,832
Peggy, do you have a sweater?

716
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:43,130
Hall closet.

717
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,205
Thanks.

718
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,602
This is her last Seder here.

719
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:54,579
This is my last Seder ever.

720
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,274
Seventh inning.

721
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:58,477
What kind of guy actually
marries a sex surrogate?

722
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,144
You know how many partners l've had?

723
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,052
An open-minded kind of guy, right?

724
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:05,717
But those kind of guys come
with their own excess baggage.

725
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:07,794
Don't walk the batter.

726
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:11,228
Why do l let her do this to me?
l'm a good person.

727
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:15,098
- l have sex with cripples, for God's sake.
- Lucky sevens.

728
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:21,473
You know, l feel much better,
thank you.

729
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,011
Oh. Hey.

730
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,880
- How's Dad doing?
- Never better.

731
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:34,147
Really? ls he tripping?

732
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:36,883
Usual tyranny,
but he seems scared.

733
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:38,288
That doesn't sound good.

734
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:39,916
That depends on your perspective.

735
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:43,360
You know what? We try to be
very sweet to you,

736
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,159
and you act like this big victim

737
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,666
because you grew up
in a smaller house than us.

738
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:50,236
First of all, it was
a one bedroom apartment,

739
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:53,932
which it wouldn't have been if Dad
hadn't left my mom for your creepy mom.

740
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,238
- You're a bitch.
- You're a privileged slut.

741
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,936
l am happy and interesting.

742
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:02,311
You...you're not.

743
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,715
l'm not happy and interesting.
That's it.

744
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,687
- Where were we?
- We're about to head back.

745
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,224
- No, we're just about to--
- Vanessa, look, l can't.

746
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,554
But we already kissed.

747
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,855
lt's against the law.

748
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,930
- l looked it up.
- Jewish law!

749
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,692
But l feel a holy spark down--

750
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:21,893
Vanessa, no. Please.

751
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,629
Fine!

752
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:29,076
But it will never happen again,
Ethan, you hear me?

753
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:31,471
Never.

754
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:42,813
Fuck it. l'll atone at Yom Kippur.

755
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:52,529
What's this? lt's sexy.
l've never seen anything like it.

756
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:55,659
lt's supposed to remind me not to sin.

757
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:57,259
You mean like this?

758
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:06,105
l feel something.

759
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:11,276
lt's like l'm angry, but l don't know
what l'm angry at.

760
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,410
That's not the X. That's you.

761
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,921
No, l'm angry because...

762
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:20,357
l lost it.

763
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:23,988
Maybe it's better l run the Seder,
Miss Stuckman.

764
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:25,156
Not in my tent.

765
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,528
lt's my tent.

766
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:30,229
My yard, my rent, my tent.

767
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:31,304
Way to lay it down, Dad.

768
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,202
Page 1 1 . Zeke.

769
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:37,106
Why do l always have to read
the four questions?

770
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:38,974
Because you are the youngest.

771
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,604
l am not. Lionel is.

772
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:44,616
So it should rotate
like every other paragraph.

773
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:46,015
Then it's still your turn.

774
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:49,983
Fine, but if it wasn't --

775
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,082
Read the damn questions before l rip
your tongue out of your mouth.

776
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:55,560
Should've given you two tabs,
you're such a prick.

777
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,096
What did you say?

778
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:59,325
"How is this night different
from all other nights?

779
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,731
On all other nights, we eat
either leavened bread or matzo.

780
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:03,302
Why on this night only matzo?

781
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:05,599
On all other nights,
we eat all kinds of herbs.

782
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:07,105
Why on this night only bitter herbs?

783
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,005
On all other nights,
we don't dip our food at all.

784
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,770
Why on this night do we dip it twice?

785
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:12,903
On all other nights,
we sit upright or reclining.

786
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:15,004
Why on this night only reclining?"

787
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:20,451
Ethan, is there an inner meaning
to the four questions?

788
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:21,680
No.

789
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,381
Really? l would have thought
that the--

790
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,082
No.

791
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:27,353
"We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt,

792
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,261
and God brought us out from there with
a strong hand and an outstretched arm.

793
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:35,665
lf God had not brought
our ancestors out of Egypt,

794
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,863
then we, our children,
and our children's children

795
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,999
would have remained
enslaved to Pharaoh in Egypt.

796
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:47,638
So even if all of us were wise
and versed in Torah,

797
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:51,479
we would still be obligated
to discuss the Exodus.

798
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:54,884
And everyone who discusses it
at length is to be praised."

799
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,958
Ethan, no wisdom to share?

800
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:00,117
Yeah, Ethan, unleash some sparks.

801
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:03,263
The key word in that last part was--

802
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:06,162
Length, isn't it?
Discussing it at length.

803
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,962
Really, guys, haven't we been here
long enough already?

804
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:10,366
- No.
- No, we have, okay?

805
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:13,065
At this point, we're not gonna eat
until midnight!

806
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,539
The key word is not " length.''
lt's ''we.''

807
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:18,373
We are enslaved, coveting the things
we cannot have, lusting--

808
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:23,178
For dinner, growing impatient.
l feel you. l got it, dude. Your turn.

809
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:28,745
"Rabbis Akiba, Joseph, Tarfon, and Elazar
ben Azaryah were celebrating the Seder.

810
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,586
These Sages discussed the Exodus all night.

811
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,287
Finally, their students entered
to announce the morning prayers.''

812
00:43:35,396 --> 00:43:39,230
''Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah

813
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,962
<i>harei ani k'ven shivim shanah v'lo zachiti</i>... <i>''</i>

814
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,267
Pay attention.

815
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,671
You think Dávid
was daydreaming at Seders?

816
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:49,902
No.

817
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:08,052
''The sages, on the other hand,
explain this passage which follows.

818
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:10,653
The 'days of your life<i>'</i>
refers to this world,

819
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:15,326
but <i>'a</i>ll the days of your life<i>'</i>
refers to the time of the Messiah."

820
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,961
These guys spent the whole night
studying one adjective.

821
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,630
Doesn't mean we have to.

822
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,504
lt's not about the adjective.
You study it to learn about yourself.

823
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:25,669
Dad, what happened
to the world's fastest Seder?

824
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:34,285
Jesus Christ, look at him.
He's tripping like a hippie.

825
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:37,380
lt's all here and now.

826
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,450
What's here and now, lra?

827
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:45,498
This Seder, Pop's Seder,
the Sages<i>'</i> Seder.

828
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,229
Peggy, you've created
a beautiful here-and-now.

829
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:54,068
The fabrics, the cushions...

830
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:57,100
the saddle.

831
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:03,577
You did great.

832
00:45:03,684 --> 00:45:05,675
Thank you very much, lra.

833
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,253
Of course, you're on drugs.

834
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:09,413
And all the other tents.

835
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:15,189
All the tents of all the Jews of all time.

836
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,593
God damn, Dad, you are tripping.

837
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:19,563
No. Listen.

838
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:22,225
We're in the desert.

839
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:25,697
We've just left Egypt.

840
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:30,573
We don't know where we're going,
but we're here now, and God--

841
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,340
...is near.

842
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:38,578
He's wasting our time.

843
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,622
l think he's cool.

844
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:47,221
l think he's Moses.

845
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,524
Guys, this is Dad.

846
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,691
There's lots of sides of him
that you don't see.

847
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:58,033
Tonight he's Moses, the most important
person in the story,

848
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:00,265
but who's never mentioned in the Haggadah

849
00:46:00,374 --> 00:46:03,866
because he's the one
leading us out of Egypt now.

850
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:07,572
Dad is Moses, and l think
he's finally feeling God.

851
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:16,988
You know what, sweetie?
We need to move on.

852
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:22,756
Okay. " Four times the Torah tells us
'And you shall tell your child.<i>'</i>

853
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,730
From this we infer that there
are four kinds of children."

854
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,926
Just like our family.

855
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,263
"One is wise,

856
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,631
one is wicked,

857
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:32,705
one is simple,

858
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:35,400
and one does not know how to ask."

859
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:38,478
Peggy, we've got five kids here.

860
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:44,079
We do.

861
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:48,086
- l'm so sorry, dear, really.
- lt's all right.

862
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:51,282
l'm gonna get some more wine.

863
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,621
Rafi, Read.

864
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:04,833
"The wise son says, 'W hat are the laws
and statutes that God has commanded you?<i>'</i>

865
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:07,406
lnstruct him in the laws of Passover

866
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:11,911
that after eating the Passover sacrifice,
we do not eat anything else."

867
00:47:12,012 --> 00:47:13,502
That's the <i>Afikomen,</i>

868
00:47:13,614 --> 00:47:18,210
so even if you do something
horrible at the Seder,

869
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:20,252
you can still leave with a blessing.

870
00:47:20,354 --> 00:47:21,912
Jennifer?

871
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:26,425
Peggy arranged the seating
so that l would get this paragraph.

872
00:47:26,527 --> 00:47:29,018
She didn't do that.
Why would she do that?

873
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:32,189
Yeah, must've been God.

874
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:36,201
Jen, the wicked son is the best one

875
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:39,932
because look at us,
we're all wicked,

876
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,372
but he asks because he wants to be good.

877
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,671
<i>When one soul</i>
<i>reaches out to another,</i>

878
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,941
<i>the spark of that light</i>
<i>flies back to God</i>.

879
00:47:48,048 --> 00:47:50,073
Fine.

880
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:54,586
''The wicked son''--daughter--

881
00:47:54,688 --> 00:47:58,180
''...says, 'What does this service
mean to you?'

882
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,725
To you and not to him.

883
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:03,091
Thus she excludes herself from her people,

884
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:06,461
and had he been there when we left Egypt,
he would not have been saved."

885
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,558
Okay, see? He asks,
and then he gets left out.

886
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:10,398
Jen, you're not left out.

887
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:14,600
You're here, and it's great.

888
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:21,173
Babe, your dad's reaching out.

889
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:23,647
Babe, my dad is stoned.

890
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:29,452
You just read, okay?

891
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:32,081
Jen, l know you're hungry,
so l'm gonna skip a few pages.

892
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:36,253
Dad, don't make this about me.
Everybody here is hungry.

893
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:39,264
- l want to do this for you.
- Oh, come on.

894
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:43,393
Because l wasn't there
when you were growing up.

895
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,971
l'm so sorry.

896
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:52,336
lra, it's about time.

897
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:55,847
There's a new me in town.

898
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:58,144
Things is gonna change.

899
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,187
Okay. See? No.

900
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,554
''Tings'' is not gonna change.

901
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:07,456
You blew it a long time ago, Dad,

902
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:11,156
and you can't just ''l'm sorry''
and make everything all right.

903
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,322
Yeah, but l can try.

904
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:14,491
We'll see what happens
when the drugs wear off.

905
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:16,592
This has nothing to do with drugs.

906
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:30,306
Well, maybe a little.

907
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:33,784
But l promise you
l'm never gonna forget this.

908
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,516
Raise your cups.

909
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:40,787
- ''Not once''--
- Wait, Dad. We should all say this.

910
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,887
''And with great joy,
not once nor twice

911
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:46,488
was out destruction planned,

912
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,627
but in every generation,
our enemies rise up to destroy us.

913
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:55,333
But the Holy One, blessed be He,
delivers us from their hands.''

914
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:56,636
Could have been more joyful.

915
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,941
What joyful? This ''And the Pharoah,
love me, love you'' business.

916
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:02,140
Nonsense!

917
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:06,982
When you thank God for deliverance,
you mean it.

918
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,248
The Egyptians, all they wanted
was to enslave us.

919
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:11,221
But the Philistines wanted us dead.

920
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:13,383
So did the Babylonians.

921
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:15,358
So did the Greeks,
so did the Romans.

922
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:19,193
Then came the lnquisition in Spain,
the Pogroms in Russia,

923
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:23,463
the Nazis in Germany
who put numbers on my arm.

924
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:27,199
They killed lra's mama.

925
00:50:27,307 --> 00:50:32,074
And his two brothers,
Dávid and lmre,

926
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,875
and his sister...

927
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:39,845
Little Magdi...

928
00:50:42,322 --> 00:50:46,725
...who made the sun shine.

929
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,856
This is the history of the world,
my friends.

930
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:57,198
When you thank God for saving you,
you'd better mean it!

931
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,034
Because if the children
of the children's children

932
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,632
of all those bastards could kill us
here and now, they would.

933
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:07,703
Grandpa, l don't think that's
what the Rebbe meant by great joy.

934
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,281
Nuts to the Rebbe.

935
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:12,215
Grandpa, the enemies
in every generation are the forces

936
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,220
that hold us back from becoming
the man or woman that we want to be.

937
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,882
Anger, prejudice, lust.

938
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,687
Those are feelings.
The bastards are real.

939
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:24,821
Feelings are real, Grandpa,
and they lead to all kinds of problems.

940
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:28,662
Even war. The Rebbe says be joyful
not just because God saves us

941
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:30,896
but because joy
frees us from those forces.

942
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,167
l'm talking about real joy,
deep joy.

943
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:36,572
lf we could all tap into that,

944
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:40,112
for just one moment,
we'd be a light unto the nations

945
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:41,612
and that would be the end of war.

946
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:44,206
Fantasy.

947
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:53,486
''And we cried out
to the God of our fathers,

948
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,660
and He heard our voice

949
00:51:55,762 --> 00:52:00,961
and remembered this Covenant
with Avram, Yitzchak, and Yaacov.''

950
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,659
l don't need a drug hug.

951
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:04,600
Pop, we've never hugged.

952
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,137
What hug? We're men.

953
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:08,400
l don't even remember
shaking hands with you.

954
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:11,238
The day l made you a partner,
l shook your hand,

955
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:13,240
and you slapped me with it.

956
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:14,836
l gave you 12 months' notice.

957
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:18,577
Six generations of Stuckmans
made fine hats, but not you.

958
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:21,848
Pop, Kennedy killed the hat.
Nobody wears them anymore.

959
00:52:21,955 --> 00:52:24,219
Baloney! Look at me.

960
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:26,519
Look at Ethan.
And look at you.

961
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:28,821
You make Christmas balls.

962
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:30,487
l make Christmas ornaments

963
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:33,657
because the people
who hid me during the war

964
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:36,531
gave me one as a present.

965
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:39,036
Pop, l'm sorry about the hat shop.

966
00:52:39,139 --> 00:52:41,004
l know you loved it.

967
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:47,245
But l'm talking about hugs here.

968
00:53:03,163 --> 00:53:05,631
l'm sorry l never hug you.

969
00:53:05,732 --> 00:53:09,828
Or listen to me, or respect me?

970
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,235
Oh, no. l respect you, kid.

971
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,868
Maybe now l understand
why you enjoy the drugs so much.

972
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:21,971
But, hey. Listen.
They're dangerous,

973
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:24,414
and l'm gonna still punish you for it.

974
00:53:24,517 --> 00:53:27,645
Don't feel you have to.

975
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:42,766
Look, l have nothing
against your profession,

976
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:46,862
l mean, l know you help people.

977
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,568
But now that you're thinking
about changing careers,

978
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:52,042
maybe your mother's right.

979
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:55,911
Are you trying to back out
of Sexologizer, Daddy?

980
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,813
Come on, sweetheart.

981
00:53:57,918 --> 00:54:00,580
You can do better
than the sex business.

982
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:19,835
Jennifer. l'm so sorry.

983
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,340
l'm so sorry about so many things.

984
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:42,027
l'm sorry that l never showed you
how much l love you.

985
00:54:42,128 --> 00:54:45,291
And maybe if l had,
you wouldn't be--

986
00:54:45,398 --> 00:54:47,866
Gay. l wouldn't be gay, Dad?

987
00:54:47,968 --> 00:54:50,960
This is unbelievable. You still think
it's your fault that l'm gay.

988
00:54:51,071 --> 00:54:53,904
All right, listen carefully.
Gay is what l am. That's it.

989
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:55,235
lt has nothing to do with you.

990
00:54:55,342 --> 00:54:57,640
Yeah, but l wasn't there
for you like the others.

991
00:54:57,744 --> 00:54:59,371
And thank God.

992
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:01,276
Dad, they are way more
screwed up than l am.

993
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,350
You've got a drug addict, a prostitute.

994
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:06,942
This guy--God bless him--
he is, you know, tragic.

995
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,021
And your precious Ethan...

996
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,891
was boning your cousin
in Dad's study not one hour ago.

997
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:25,299
Dude.

998
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:29,639
Nice.

999
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:35,004
l built this tent for you.

1000
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:39,882
l bought plates for you. l roasted a goddamn
lamb because you're so holy.

1001
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:42,454
And you have sex with my cousin?

1002
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:43,783
l'm sorry.

1003
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,585
ln my house?

1004
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:51,291
- l'm sorry.
- So, Eth,

1005
00:55:51,398 --> 00:55:55,232
Notice any sparks floating back to God
while you were committing incest?

1006
00:55:56,536 --> 00:55:59,835
- lt is not incest.
- Really?

1007
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,497
Cousins, not incest.

1008
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,940
Once removed.
lt's a gray area.

1009
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:06,342
l knew that hassid junk was an act.

1010
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,710
lt is not an act, okay?
l slipped.

1011
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:10,180
That's part of the process.

1012
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,548
lt's not like l had an affair because
my wife wouldn't have me, Dad.

1013
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:19,090
That's a lie.

1014
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:20,682
Really, Mom?

1015
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:25,254
That's a lie. lt never happened.

1016
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:31,304
That thing that never happened
never happened a long time ago.

1017
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,469
lt never happened.

1018
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,985
One of you go.

1019
00:57:21,554 --> 00:57:23,954
They don't deserve you, Peggy.

1020
00:57:28,294 --> 00:57:32,094
Lousy supermarket macaroons.

1021
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,393
She buys the same ones every year.

1022
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,593
Thank you.

1023
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:42,471
You know, it's funny.

1024
00:57:42,575 --> 00:57:46,443
ln lsrael, when they say ''macaroons,''
it's like ''macaroni.''

1025
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,673
lt's like spaghetti.

1026
00:57:48,781 --> 00:57:51,648
Every time in America, when they say,
''Do you want macaroons?''

1027
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:54,083
l say no because l hate spaghetti.

1028
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:58,920
Not spaghetti bolognese,
but a little spaghetti--

1029
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,044
Whose turn is it?

1030
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:20,772
Okay, then good. l'll go.

1031
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,848
No. Honey, don't.

1032
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,343
- Lift your cups.
- Please don't do this.

1033
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:30,252
Guys, you're on to something here.

1034
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:34,850
Something your family needs.
Go with it.

1035
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:40,661
Jesus said, ''Blessed are those
who weep, for they will laugh.''

1036
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,598
Honey, it's the wrong crowd.

1037
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:45,193
Jesus was Jewish, honey.

1038
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:47,739
He got it from Ecclesiastes, okay?

1039
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,966
Lift your cups.

1040
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:51,908
Excuse me, but where do you get off
telling us what to do?

1041
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:53,569
l'm the matzo bearer.

1042
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,582
Without me, there would be no matzo.

1043
00:58:57,684 --> 00:58:59,208
Now, little girl.

1044
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,684
Lift your damn cups.

1045
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,561
''Wherefor it is our duty

1046
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:19,934
to thank, to praise,

1047
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:24,100
to honor, to glorify,

1048
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,678
to exalt, to commend,

1049
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:29,976
to bless, to extoll, and to acclaim Him

1050
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:33,211
who performed all these
miraculous deeds

1051
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:37,050
for our fathers and for us.

1052
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:41,490
He brought us forth
from bondage to freedom,

1053
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:43,653
from anguish to joy,

1054
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:47,096
from darkness to great light,

1055
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,294
from servitude to redemption,

1056
00:59:50,403 --> 00:59:54,464
Let us therefore
sing before Him a new song.

1057
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:57,737
Praise You the Lord. Hallelujah!

1058
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,277
Hallelujah.

1059
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:06,010
Ethan, sing that song,
that new song.

1060
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,347
Forget it.

1061
01:00:07,453 --> 01:00:09,045
Honey, l think we should go.

1062
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:14,353
No. We need this.
We need this for us.

1063
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:21,523
l kissed Rafi...

1064
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:26,371
like l haven't kissed anyone in years.

1065
01:00:28,574 --> 01:00:30,974
Beause you're not the man
l married anymore.

1066
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:37,615
And, Ethan, you want to talk
about pharaohs,

1067
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,685
you're my pharaoh.

1068
01:00:40,787 --> 01:00:42,516
All of you.

1069
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:45,453
l have been a slave
to this family for years.

1070
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:47,752
30 years l've been feeding you

1071
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:52,058
and dressing you and driving you

1072
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:57,068
and trying to keep the peace,

1073
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,799
and l've so failed at that.

1074
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,709
Trying to make a loving...

1075
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:08,212
presentable family of all of you,

1076
01:01:08,314 --> 01:01:11,283
and l've failed at that, too.

1077
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:17,321
So l'm not sure when l'll be back. Just--

1078
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:27,256
Mom, don't say that stuff. lt's almost dinner.
You made it, we'll love it, and--

1079
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:29,631
l'm really sorry about what l said.

1080
01:01:29,736 --> 01:01:32,034
- No, you are not.
- Yes, l am.

1081
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:34,538
Mom, there's no excuse
for what l did. l'm an ass.

1082
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,108
You had sex at a Seder
that l made for you.

1083
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,973
Mom, please...

1084
01:01:39,078 --> 01:01:40,602
Peggy, l'm sorry l said anything.

1085
01:01:40,713 --> 01:01:41,975
Please, Jennifer, don't bother.

1086
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:44,811
Daddy, please say something.

1087
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,441
What can l say? She's right.

1088
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:49,180
- Seven minutes.
- Okay, Mom--

1089
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,755
Seven minutes.

1090
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:53,485
- Mom, listen to him.
- l can't do it.

1091
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,424
You're gonna want to stay for this.

1092
01:01:55,528 --> 01:01:56,517
What?

1093
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:03,499
l'm a...

1094
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:05,594
What did you say, baby?

1095
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:11,677
Ah, hell, l'm not autistic.

1096
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,581
Oh, my God, Mom!
You guys help me.

1097
01:02:16,682 --> 01:02:19,276
Dude, you owe me a hundred bucks.

1098
01:02:22,288 --> 01:02:24,381
She's not here.

1099
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:29,853
You're such a dick.

1100
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:32,260
You're such a pussy.

1101
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:34,196
At least l'm master of all galaxies.

1102
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,131
So am l.

1103
01:02:36,235 --> 01:02:37,202
Liar.

1104
01:02:37,303 --> 01:02:38,668
Look.

1105
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:41,001
l'll be master by tomorrow.

1106
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:46,272
Dude, no. And, if they knew
how bad you were at video games,

1107
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:47,710
the gig would be up.

1108
01:02:47,814 --> 01:02:50,044
Only 1 out of 10 is a savant.

1109
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:54,245
But Dad always says,
''Lionel's an idiot savant.''

1110
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,583
Mom just says you're
relatively high functioning.

1111
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,385
l really am evil, huh?

1112
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:01,255
So come out.

1113
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,488
l can't just come out.
l gotta find my way back

1114
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:07,998
thanks to their years of teamwork
and doting attention.

1115
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,365
Hundred bucks says
you blow it before you're 15.

1116
01:03:11,471 --> 01:03:14,133
Should have lost that bet
a long time ago. l'm sorry.

1117
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,174
And the doctors?

1118
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:19,676
They wanted to find something wrong.
All of you did.

1119
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:23,237
l just didn't talk at first, you know?
l certainly wasn't normal.

1120
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:26,045
And then you guys,
you're all such big talkers

1121
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:28,916
that compared to you,
l seemed especially off,

1122
01:03:29,021 --> 01:03:31,285
and then the doctors called it autism,

1123
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,915
and l don't know, l just went with it

1124
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:38,087
because l realized that l wouldn't
catch Dad's wrath, like Zeke or Ethan,

1125
01:03:38,197 --> 01:03:40,188
or get the curse with Mom, like Nikki,

1126
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:43,029
and l just shut my mouth,
and that was that.

1127
01:03:43,135 --> 01:03:48,835
Not to say it was a great decision.
lt was a very, very poor one.

1128
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:53,173
But l figured out that l could
stop your fights with an episode.

1129
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:57,340
And, Mom, you became
this champion for my cause,

1130
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,887
and for a while l was the only
thing that kept us a family.

1131
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:04,684
Those were good things,
really good things.

1132
01:04:05,992 --> 01:04:09,519
What can l say, but...

1133
01:04:09,629 --> 01:04:11,290
l'm sorry, guys.

1134
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:25,444
Excuse me.

1135
01:04:26,812 --> 01:04:28,507
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1136
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:37,856
You goddamn liar!

1137
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:44,419
You goddamn freak!

1138
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,100
Dad, please! This is awesome.

1139
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:52,830
Awesome? No! He's the devil.

1140
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:54,531
Okay, Dad, please, let's just--

1141
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,167
And all of you,
you're out of your minds.

1142
01:04:58,277 --> 01:05:00,507
This tent bullshit!

1143
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:02,205
l guess he's not Moses anymore.

1144
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,010
Shut up!

1145
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:06,414
lra, we're all a little overwhelmed.

1146
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:08,077
Just sit down.

1147
01:05:08,187 --> 01:05:09,552
What happened?

1148
01:05:14,794 --> 01:05:19,197
Lionel, what's with the sevens?

1149
01:05:19,298 --> 01:05:22,734
Yeah, that was just to get the receipts.

1150
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:24,700
You needed the receipts why?

1151
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:28,467
They have merchant numbers,

1152
01:05:28,574 --> 01:05:33,602
and l wrote a protocol
for credit card authorizers

1153
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:36,113
so l could borrow and float

1154
01:05:36,215 --> 01:05:39,616
on the interval between approval
and the actual debit.

1155
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:41,380
You're a hacker?

1156
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:43,079
How much did you get?

1157
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,747
About a million 5.

1158
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,417
Dude, you never told me that.

1159
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,959
You're a thief.

1160
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:51,086
Mom, it's a gray area,

1161
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,894
but you and Dad keep the money
for all l've put you through.

1162
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:56,400
What about the rest of us?

1163
01:05:56,502 --> 01:05:59,130
- You knew.
- Not about that!

1164
01:05:59,238 --> 01:06:02,605
You know, l didn't know, so if you want
to invest in Sexologizer, we could--

1165
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,300
No, Nikki, he doesn't.

1166
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,638
Mom, it was a joke.

1167
01:06:05,745 --> 01:06:11,445
This money is going
to the Autism Society...period.

1168
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:18,953
Did l tell you he was genius?

1169
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,891
My son, a genius.

1170
01:06:21,994 --> 01:06:26,795
l told you it had to do
with number 7.

1171
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,129
Dad, it had nothing
to do with the 7's.

1172
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,725
Uh, folks?

1173
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:41,375
Holy land tent is waterproof, Rafi?

1174
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:47,112
No, this is--in lslam,
the rain is different. lt's...

1175
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,445
Okay, l lied.

1176
01:06:54,293 --> 01:06:56,784
Okay, right.

1177
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:40,403
Waterlogged outside, dried out inside.

1178
01:07:40,506 --> 01:07:42,474
Do you have a pressure cooker?

1179
01:07:56,222 --> 01:07:57,519
Paprika?

1180
01:08:35,561 --> 01:08:39,292
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1181
01:08:39,398 --> 01:08:40,365
Who'd l miss?

1182
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,525
Wow, the room looks great.

1183
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:45,228
Thank you. We worked as one.

1184
01:08:45,337 --> 01:08:48,363
One hungry son of a bitch.

1185
01:08:52,511 --> 01:08:55,241
Do you even like the clothes l buy you?

1186
01:08:55,347 --> 01:08:58,373
Yeah, some of 'em.

1187
01:08:58,484 --> 01:09:01,112
You must have felt so lonely.

1188
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,018
l had friends online, and there was Zeke.

1189
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:09,893
All right, let's refill the glasses,
top off Elijah's cup.

1190
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:11,656
That's for the prophet Elijah.

1191
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:15,564
Later, we'll open the door for him,
and one of these years he'll come in

1192
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:17,568
and announce the day
of the Lord is here.

1193
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:19,661
l'd settle for a pizza.

1194
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:22,138
l'm gonna wash my hands and then--

1195
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,869
Yes, we'll hide the <i>Afikomen</i>.

1196
01:09:24,977 --> 01:09:28,674
No, Peg, we're gonna do it your way.

1197
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:32,774
l'm gonna hide the <i>Afikomen</i>.
The kids are gonna find it later.

1198
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:36,343
And, Ethan, you're still banned.

1199
01:09:36,455 --> 01:09:39,424
That was 15 years ago.

1200
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:44,287
What the hell are you humming about?

1201
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,626
l'm filling in for Moses,
and l'm doing a pretty good job.

1202
01:09:50,736 --> 01:09:53,068
Moses? You ain't done bupkes.

1203
01:09:53,172 --> 01:09:57,438
When the drugs wear off, Jen will still
hate you, Ethan will take the job,

1204
01:09:57,543 --> 01:10:00,410
Peggy won't touch you,
and Pop will still think you're a putz.

1205
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:10,416
He forgot to hide it.

1206
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:13,491
Dad, you with us?

1207
01:10:13,592 --> 01:10:15,651
l thought he was down.

1208
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:17,695
- lt's a roller coaster.
- Oh.

1209
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:28,533
Dad. Come on.

1210
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:31,876
Okay, Dad, just look at your plate.

1211
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,706
For the sake of time,

1212
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:35,973
we set up all
the offerings already.

1213
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,675
All we need to do
is bless and eat, all right?

1214
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:40,979
Ready?

1215
01:10:41,086 --> 01:10:43,953
Dad, just eat when we tell you.

1216
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:48,817
Vanessa, eat.

1217
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:51,226
''Blessed are you,
Lord, our God,

1218
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,524
ruler of the Universe

1219
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:54,690
who has sanctified us
with Commandments,

1220
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,325
and commanded us
to eat matzo.''

1221
01:10:57,436 --> 01:10:59,301
Zeke.

1222
01:10:59,405 --> 01:11:01,373
''Blessed are you,
Lord, our God,

1223
01:11:01,473 --> 01:11:02,565
ruler of the Universe

1224
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,142
who has sanctified us
with Commandments,

1225
01:11:04,243 --> 01:11:07,303
and commanded us
to eat the bitter herb.''

1226
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:12,277
''And this is what Rabbi Hillel did
in the time of the Holy Temple.

1227
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:14,113
He would combine
the Passover sacrifice,

1228
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:16,119
matzo, and bitter herb--''

1229
01:11:16,221 --> 01:11:18,781
Does anyone else get constipated
from all this matzo?

1230
01:11:18,891 --> 01:11:19,858
Yes.

1231
01:11:19,959 --> 01:11:22,154
All rightie. That's that.

1232
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:23,558
Mom. Boys.

1233
01:11:23,662 --> 01:11:25,391
Wait. Where are you going?

1234
01:11:25,497 --> 01:11:28,466
Page 28 . The Festive Meal.

1235
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:36,302
Seconds, please.

1236
01:11:36,408 --> 01:11:38,035
Save your appetite.

1237
01:11:38,143 --> 01:11:40,270
Peggy's got a phenomenal
meal in store.

1238
01:11:49,822 --> 01:11:52,382
The gefilte fish is kosher
for Passover, Ethan.

1239
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:54,049
l checked.

1240
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,389
The Rebbe says no packaged
foods on Passover.

1241
01:11:56,495 --> 01:11:59,555
And what does the Rebbe say
about shtupping your cousin?

1242
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,800
What? lt's matzo-ball soup.

1243
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:08,873
The Rebbe says--

1244
01:12:08,974 --> 01:12:11,135
What could the Rebbe possibly say
about matzo-ball soup?

1245
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:15,942
He says that when you put matzo
in water long enough, it leavens.

1246
01:12:16,048 --> 01:12:20,007
The food.
lt has to do with the food.

1247
01:12:22,388 --> 01:12:24,015
Thank you very much.

1248
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:26,057
Mom, wonderful job.

1249
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:28,649
l made the lamb.
We made the stew.

1250
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,456
Mom, how'd you make
the stew so fast?

1251
01:12:30,562 --> 01:12:32,553
Pressure cooker.
Jen's idea.

1252
01:12:32,664 --> 01:12:33,653
Thank you very much.

1253
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,030
This stew is very good,
the way lra and Molly used to make it.

1254
01:12:36,135 --> 01:12:37,500
What, Ethan?

1255
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,833
lt's your old
pressure cooker, right?

1256
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:41,200
Hey, Mom, it's not kosher.

1257
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:44,366
Ethan, l'm sorry
that we made a mistake,

1258
01:12:44,476 --> 01:12:47,206
but l really think
the holy thing to do

1259
01:12:47,312 --> 01:12:51,544
would be to eat the Festive Meal
along with your family, including--

1260
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,379
Come here. Your resurrected brother,
he'll tell you how good it is.

1261
01:12:53,485 --> 01:12:57,888
lt's amazing, but he's obviously
trying to heed a higher calling, okay?

1262
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,184
Shut up, Lionel.

1263
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,691
Ethan, why would God
care what you eat?

1264
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,024
God cares that l'm trying
to do the right thing now,

1265
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,096
especially tonight.

1266
01:13:05,197 --> 01:13:06,459
But it won't change the past.

1267
01:13:06,565 --> 01:13:08,192
Let the religious do his way.

1268
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,361
Why has my dinner become
a boys versus girls debate?

1269
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,336
What does Moses say?

1270
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,210
Yeah. Stick up
for the boys, Dad.

1271
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:45,734
Will you all submit to my decision?

1272
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,033
Look, l'm not gonna eat
the lamb, okay? Please.

1273
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,040
Thought you were serious
when you called me Moses.

1274
01:13:50,142 --> 01:13:51,973
No, it just served him at the time.

1275
01:13:53,145 --> 01:13:55,670
l'll submit to a fair decision.

1276
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:56,770
And the rest of you?

1277
01:13:56,882 --> 01:13:59,009
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

1278
01:13:59,118 --> 01:14:01,746
Ethan wants to eat the stew
as much as anyone,

1279
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,719
but he's willing to make
a sacrifice.

1280
01:14:03,822 --> 01:14:04,846
Right on, Dad.

1281
01:14:04,957 --> 01:14:06,982
No, Zeke. He's wrong,

1282
01:14:07,092 --> 01:14:08,650
beause there's no religion on Earth

1283
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,593
that says it's all right
to hurt your mother's feelings.

1284
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,096
Go, Moses.

1285
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,426
Go ahead, son. Eat.

1286
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,933
l said l'd submit to
a fair decision, Dad.

1287
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,003
Yours is personal.

1288
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:21,004
You're just steamed
l won't work for you.

1289
01:14:21,106 --> 01:14:22,733
ls that what all of you heard?

1290
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:24,570
Doesn't matter
what they heard, Dad.

1291
01:14:24,676 --> 01:14:25,973
You want me to take over
the business,

1292
01:14:26,078 --> 01:14:27,670
you know l won't,
and it pisses you off.

1293
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:30,304
Do l sound pissed off?

1294
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:33,509
Dad, listen to me!

1295
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:35,177
l'm not gonna make Santa balls.

1296
01:14:35,287 --> 01:14:36,652
Why do you mock something

1297
01:14:36,755 --> 01:14:39,189
that l've worked all my life
to give you?

1298
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:41,452
Because, Dad...

1299
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:45,862
this night aside,
you're a miserable old bastard.

1300
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:47,295
l don't want to be you.

1301
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,501
Take that back.

1302
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,662
Take it back, Ethan.

1303
01:14:53,772 --> 01:14:55,672
Nah, Nikki, it's okay.

1304
01:14:55,774 --> 01:14:58,675
That's not my pharaoh, Ethan.
lt's yours.

1305
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:01,337
You're enslaved to not being me.

1306
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,750
Maybe, maybe, uh,

1307
01:15:07,853 --> 01:15:10,014
maybe you don't know me
that well, huh?

1308
01:15:10,122 --> 01:15:12,682
Maybe.

1309
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:14,349
Maybe l don't know you, right?

1310
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:16,654
Yeah.

1311
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,491
What do you say...

1312
01:15:20,532 --> 01:15:21,897
we have lunch?

1313
01:15:25,804 --> 01:15:28,170
There's a kosher place
right by your office.

1314
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:29,763
lt's a start.

1315
01:15:31,843 --> 01:15:32,867
Tell you what.

1316
01:15:32,978 --> 01:15:34,309
You don't have to eat the lamb.

1317
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:37,940
No, that's not being serious, Dad.
That's taking a love bribe.

1318
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,109
Nikki, are you against
a love bribe,

1319
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:42,449
or are you still mad that l
backed out of Sexologizer?

1320
01:15:42,554 --> 01:15:45,546
You just made a decision
based on Mom's feelings, right?

1321
01:15:45,657 --> 01:15:48,820
You're now saying that Ethan's
are more important.

1322
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:51,657
That is the first time l heard you
defend your mother.

1323
01:15:51,763 --> 01:15:53,355
Just answer my question.

1324
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:57,424
Ethan, this must be proof
that God exists.

1325
01:15:57,536 --> 01:16:00,664
The day your sister
defends your mother

1326
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:04,674
is the day God will permit you
to eat some lamb.

1327
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:06,403
Moses my tuchus.

1328
01:16:06,511 --> 01:16:09,139
lf every judge thought like you,

1329
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:12,649
the Fourth Reich would run the world,
and we'd all be dead.

1330
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,719
You're milk-livered, lra.
You always were.

1331
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,586
Pop, you're stuck in the past.
You always were.

1332
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:21,488
What stuck? l brought you
to America.

1333
01:16:26,131 --> 01:16:28,031
Why do you always
carry around this suitcase?

1334
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:29,725
Because l'm smart.

1335
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,963
You never know when the bastards
are coming, especially nowadays.

1336
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:34,698
You've been carrying it
around for 60 years.

1337
01:16:34,806 --> 01:16:37,434
So? l'm a survivor.

1338
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:39,703
And if l didn't keep surviving,

1339
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:42,211
your mama and your two brothers
and your sister

1340
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:43,281
would have died for nothing.

1341
01:16:43,382 --> 01:16:45,316
- But l'm here, Pop.
- Yeah, you're here.

1342
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:47,942
Yeah, l'm here.

1343
01:16:48,053 --> 01:16:52,547
l may not read Hebrew like Dávid
or sing like lmre

1344
01:16:52,658 --> 01:16:55,218
or make the sun shine like Magdi.

1345
01:16:56,995 --> 01:16:59,156
But l'm here, Pop.

1346
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:02,495
l survived.

1347
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:05,502
You survived, and for what?

1348
01:17:05,604 --> 01:17:09,233
Six generations of Stuckmans
made fine hats.

1349
01:17:09,341 --> 01:17:12,071
Hitler murdered our whole family,

1350
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:14,611
but he could not take that
away from me, but you did.

1351
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,680
Why?

1352
01:17:15,781 --> 01:17:17,976
l'm sorry, Pop.

1353
01:17:22,321 --> 01:17:23,310
Well...

1354
01:17:23,422 --> 01:17:26,118
l miss them, lra.

1355
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:31,694
l know you do.

1356
01:17:43,308 --> 01:17:45,776
l'll give you one thing.

1357
01:17:45,877 --> 01:17:49,244
Your mother, she didn't care much
about the hat business, either.

1358
01:17:49,348 --> 01:17:50,747
She didn't?

1359
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:53,443
No, she always said,
''Artur, you have such a beautiful voice.

1360
01:17:53,552 --> 01:17:54,985
Should be a cantor.''

1361
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,577
Of course.

1362
01:17:56,688 --> 01:18:01,148
lra, let Ethan do what he wants.

1363
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:06,996
Thank you, Grandpa.

1364
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,066
You know what?

1365
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:11,863
lt's not gonna be a fair decision
until Mom speaks.

1366
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,403
lt freaks me out
that you're a regular kid.

1367
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:16,167
Wait till you get to know him.
He's a regular yutz.

1368
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:20,001
- What's a yutz?
- Mom?

1369
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:24,412
l don't really care
what Ethan eats anymore.

1370
01:18:24,516 --> 01:18:26,416
No, Lionel's right.

1371
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:28,247
l owe you, Peg.

1372
01:18:29,654 --> 01:18:32,782
Not only for all the wonderful
Saders you've made,

1373
01:18:32,891 --> 01:18:34,916
but especially for this one.

1374
01:18:35,026 --> 01:18:36,015
Thank you.

1375
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:39,393
You know, your mother
always believed in me.

1376
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:42,467
She believed in me when l started
a Christmas business,

1377
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:47,300
l believed making her happy,
making her proud.

1378
01:18:47,406 --> 01:18:51,536
And l worked hard. Oh, geez.

1379
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:55,340
Then l'd come home tired,

1380
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:58,075
and expected some gratitude, you know?

1381
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,578
Stupid, huh?

1382
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:06,953
Didn't matter that she was busy
raising you guys,

1383
01:19:07,058 --> 01:19:09,219
working for the Autism Society.

1384
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:15,459
So that's when we stopped talking
and l started yelling.

1385
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:19,196
Yeah, there was another woman.

1386
01:19:21,473 --> 01:19:24,840
She looked a lot like your mother.
She was very sweet to me.

1387
01:19:24,943 --> 01:19:25,910
We kissed.

1388
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,809
One night, we took a hotel room--

1389
01:19:28,914 --> 01:19:31,974
l think l can speak for all of us.
None of us need to hear this.

1390
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,948
Please, Ethan, let me finish.

1391
01:19:34,052 --> 01:19:36,247
Dad, it's like the end
of <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i>

1392
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:39,619
when Dorothy goes on and on
about everything that she's learned.

1393
01:19:39,724 --> 01:19:41,419
We're all Dorothied out.

1394
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:43,187
Zeke, please.

1395
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:46,093
And you know what?

1396
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:48,928
l ran out of that room.

1397
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,229
Yes, l love you, Peggy.

1398
01:19:51,336 --> 01:19:54,533
And l always have.

1399
01:19:59,411 --> 01:20:04,075
l loved the way
l used to make you laugh.

1400
01:20:04,182 --> 01:20:06,707
Remember when
we moved into the house?

1401
01:20:06,818 --> 01:20:11,152
Had that pizza,
and tried to read with a candle.

1402
01:20:11,256 --> 01:20:12,382
Remember that?

1403
01:20:12,491 --> 01:20:17,155
l know. You don't believe
that guy exists anymore.

1404
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:18,661
l know that.

1405
01:20:18,763 --> 01:20:24,724
After all these years of bullying you
and screaming at the kids,

1406
01:20:24,836 --> 01:20:26,736
never paying any attention to you,

1407
01:20:26,838 --> 01:20:29,398
never listening to your thoughts.

1408
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:34,978
l swear to you...

1409
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,311
l'm not that man anymore.

1410
01:21:03,308 --> 01:21:07,972
People don't change
in one night, lra.

1411
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:12,448
Peggy, l can try.

1412
01:21:47,218 --> 01:21:50,881
Well, at least Ethan's free
to eat his matzo and salad.

1413
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:52,217
Maybe he'll get matztipated.

1414
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:55,555
- Get it? Matzo and constipated?
- Hey!

1415
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,355
Grandpa. Kosher?

1416
01:21:57,462 --> 01:21:59,225
- Wow.
- Of course.

1417
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:01,865
Hey. Where are you going?

1418
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:04,128
lt's okay. Kiss your wife.

1419
01:22:04,235 --> 01:22:06,100
Rafi. Come on.

1420
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:11,107
Stay. You helped us with the tent.
You went through hell with us.

1421
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:12,904
Come on. Sit down.

1422
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,239
Stuckman.

1423
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:18,007
l stay.

1424
01:22:18,116 --> 01:22:19,140
Ethan, what's left?

1425
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:23,277
Eat the <i>afikomen</i>, two cups of wine,
and open the door for Elijah.

1426
01:22:23,388 --> 01:22:25,288
Pass the <i>afikomen</i>.

1427
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:28,450
Blessed are You, Lord our God,
ruler of the universe,

1428
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,653
who creates the fruit of the vine.

1429
01:22:39,404 --> 01:22:40,336
Ethan.

1430
01:22:43,475 --> 01:22:45,443
Teach us that song.

1431
01:22:48,246 --> 01:22:50,043
lt's really for any holiday,

1432
01:22:50,148 --> 01:22:53,447
any time you're thankful
to be around the ones you love.

1433
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:58,113
Blessed are you, Lord, our God
that brings us to this moment of joy.

1434
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,088
Come on, Eth. Sing for us.

1435
01:23:00,191 --> 01:23:03,024
<i>Baruch Atah</i>

1436
01:23:03,128 --> 01:23:07,997
<i>Adonai Eloheinu Melech ha'olam,</i>

1437
01:23:08,099 --> 01:23:12,035
<i>shehechiyanu, v'ki-y'manu,</i>

1438
01:23:12,137 --> 01:23:16,767
<i>v'higianu lazman hazeh</i>.

1439
01:23:25,483 --> 01:23:28,316
Hey, don't!

1440
01:23:31,856 --> 01:23:36,020
<i>A-a-a-men</i>.

1441
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,398
Zeke, go get the door for Elijah.

1442
01:23:53,378 --> 01:23:56,472
Whoa, l didn't even knock yet.

1443
01:23:56,581 --> 01:23:59,345
Shaffer?

1444
01:23:59,517 --> 01:24:02,714
Hey, man. Your family sings.

1445
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:05,153
That's cool.

1446
01:24:05,256 --> 01:24:07,690
Hey, it couldn't have
been that bad, huh?

1447
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:10,226
Yeah, l mean, no.

1448
01:24:10,328 --> 01:24:12,660
l mean, thanks.

1449
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:15,164
Thanks, dude, really.

1450
01:24:15,266 --> 01:24:17,325
Whoa, man. Whoa.

1451
01:24:17,435 --> 01:24:20,996
Don't get all sarcastic on me, okay.

1452
01:24:21,106 --> 01:24:23,768
Look, l'm sorry that l jacked you over.

1453
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:27,038
l was sorting pills
when my Dad got home, and l freaked.

1454
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:31,673
l started mixing in the perkys
with the jolly beans,

1455
01:24:31,783 --> 01:24:33,512
and the roofies were there,

1456
01:24:33,618 --> 01:24:38,078
and basically,
you got kiddie aspirin.

1457
01:24:38,189 --> 01:24:40,350
They look alike, you know?

1458
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,790
The pills, they all blend together.

1459
01:24:42,894 --> 01:24:48,264
Anyhow, here is the ''Touch God X.''

1460
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:51,096
lt's real.

1461
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:57,167
Hey, we're hitting a bangin' rave
a little later.

1462
01:24:57,275 --> 01:24:59,038
Wanna roll with us?

1463
01:24:59,144 --> 01:25:02,602
No, thanks.

1464
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:04,909
Whatever, man.

1465
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,949
Later, man.

1466
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,970
So your cellphone.

1467
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:02,596
Does it has a number?

1468
01:26:04,676 --> 01:26:07,372
Rafi, about the tent--

1469
01:26:07,478 --> 01:26:09,878
Next year, improved.

1470
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:12,449
Next year, in Jerusalem.

1471
01:26:26,798 --> 01:26:29,631
<i>Amen</i>.

1472
01:26:29,734 --> 01:26:31,133
One more time!
