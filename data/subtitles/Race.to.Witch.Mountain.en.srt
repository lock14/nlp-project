1
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:52,884
I've never seen that. Honest.

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,889
- A saucer...
- Right on a dry lake bed.

3
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:07,816
- What's your status?
- Are you getting that on radar?

4
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,444
They won't admit
UFOs are real because...

5
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,945
They're among us today.

6
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,000
UFOs are visiting our planet.

7
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,215
- UFOs are real and they know it.
- Something happened.

8
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,176
- I know what I saw...
- Of course UFOs exist.

9
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:46,021
We are facing an alien threat
from outside this world.

10
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:56,281
If the United States Air Force
did recover alien bodies...

11
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,533
UFOs are as real as you and me.

12
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:04,206
Unless the military proves me wrong,
I saw an alien spacecraft.

13
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:19,471
You felt a connection to your heart,
and heard directions in your mind.

14
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,075
One UFO sighting.

15
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,579
There's more than meets the eye.

16
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:48,417
UFOs are manifesting themselves
to people.

17
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,045
What we're talking about
is the greatest cover-up

18
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,715
in the history of mankind.

19
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,437
Object of unknown origin
is at 90 k and descending fast!

20
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,104
Get me a visual track now!

21
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,859
Zero match with
anything on our database.

22
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,276
It's manoeuvring.

23
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,615
We're registering impact!

24
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,204
Get me Henry Burke. Now.

25
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,295
Hey. Do you think this is it?
It's the real deal, right?

26
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,133
You'll learn.

27
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:49,061
Squad and equipment locked and loaded.
I re-routed local law and media.

28
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,979
Impact was eight minutes ago.
How long until we land?

29
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,942
Imperial Droid,
drive your Geonosian starfighters

30
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,528
to Planet... Hollywood.

31
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:45,574
Die! Die! Hey!
Give me... No! Come on!

32
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,146
Awesome.

33
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,901
Extend the perimeter.
No one gets in.

34
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,237
Nothing gets out.

35
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,283
Planet Hollywood, please.

36
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:35,417
They've got everything here.

37
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,004
This place is truly like
being on another planet.

38
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,298
With all this to see every night,
you must never get bored.

39
00:05:57,314 --> 00:06:00,149
Welcome to the nutjob convention.

40
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:03,319
I understand your reaction.
They aren't helping our cause.

41
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:04,862
Our cause?

42
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:09,826
Educating the public on the possibility
of life on other planets.

43
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,536
As a matter of fact,
I'm giving a lecture

44
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,665
on Astrophysical Anomaly Detection
at the nutjob convention.

45
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,461
Feel free to stop by.
Sceptics are always welcome.

46
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,713
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

47
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,677
Dr Alex Friedman.

48
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,307
A classic.

49
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,754
Hey, come on! Knock it off, will ya?

50
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,341
I need to sleep!

51
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,925
Yeah, me, too.

52
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:19,896
Now, Channel 13 Action News
in high-definition continues.

53
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,523
Casey Smith,
back with a news alert.

54
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:24,108
- An accident near Searchlight.
- I'm Tricia Kean.

55
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,653
We're gonna take you to our
reporter, live on the scene.

56
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,240
Officials are calling it the worst
chlorine spill in state history.

57
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,367
A five-mile security perimeter
has been established.

58
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,995
Highway patrol officers
have been re-routing traffic

59
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,456
since the morning hours,
we're now being told

60
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,334
this section of Route 95
will be closed indefinitely.

61
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,838
This is Natalie Gann reporting.

62
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:41,769
The casts we pulled out of the trench
indicate a distinct pattern

63
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,357
alternating between the depth of
the impressions here and here.

64
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,818
Suggesting not one,
but two separate EBEs.

65
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,613
They were moving fast.

66
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,155
Bipedal...

67
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,659
...possibly humanoid in form.

68
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:03,082
Review every data-gathering
entity within a 50-mile radius,

69
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,671
starting upon impact.
Look out for any anomalies.

70
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,553
You guys gotta move this thing.
I gotta go. Come on.

71
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,346
Jack.

72
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,225
You don't return
phone calls anymore?

73
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,226
Mr Wolfe thinks
you're being rude.

74
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,480
Tell Wolfe that when I said it
was the last time, I meant it.

75
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,234
Mr Wolfe decides when it's
the last time. Not you, Jack.

76
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,652
He likes you, Jackie.

77
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:33,321
Hates to see you wasting
your God-given driving talent

78
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:36,032
giving fat tourists cab rides
up and down the Strip.

79
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:38,493
Buddy, what kind
of life is that?

80
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,702
It's one I'm late for.

81
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,794
- You got a death wish?
- I drive a cab in Vegas.

82
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,508
You're dead, Jack.

83
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:58,096
Hey! What are you doing?
Man, are you insane?

84
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,764
Move this out of the taxi zone
before I give you a ticket.

85
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,892
See you soon, Jackie.

86
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:26,081
- Where did you come from?
- Outside.

87
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,418
I figured that part out on my own.
How did you get in the car?

88
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,879
Through that portal.

89
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,465
I am Seth.
This is my sister, Sara.

90
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:35,799
We require transportation
services immediately.

91
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:37,635
Really? Well, I require...

92
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,306
- A currency transaction.
- Would this amount suffice?

93
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,308
- Did you two rob a bank?
- Is this acceptable, Jack Bruno?

94
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,562
How did you know my name?

95
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,481
If we have a deal for your services,
we must move forward rapidly.

96
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,859
It is urgent we get to our
destination without delay.

97
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:54,235
All right. I'm going.

98
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,446
Where to?

99
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,120
- I need an address.
- We must travel in that direction.

100
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,583
I'm gonna need something more specific
than just "that direction. "

101
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:14,339
We must locate latitude 40.54
cross-intersecting longitude...

102
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,591
We're just gonna stick
with "that direction. "

103
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:23,847
We tracked the two sets of EBE
footprints on and off for 7.3 miles,

104
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,767
losing them at a
rest stop off the highway.

105
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,937
Four hours, 19 minutes
post-impact, there was a highway

106
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,023
patrol incident report filed at...
the exact same rest stop.

107
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,775
A car trunk was burglarised,
no signs of forced entry.

108
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,028
Give me something
better than that, Mr Pope!

109
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,614
Stolen clothing belonging
to a couple of teenagers.

110
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,365
We're in the game. Let's roll.

111
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,909
Two kids don't walk down
the highway alone at night.

112
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,205
We got a bus. Landing roughly at
the same time, same rest stop.

113
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:48,873
Thirty-nine people exit.

114
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,875
Fast-forward to the passengers
re-entering the vehicle.

115
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,462
- Fast-forwarding.
- Stop. Rewind.

116
00:11:57,298 --> 00:11:58,633
Freeze.

117
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,969
There.

118
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:03,178
Looks like the bus picked up
extra baggage.

119
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,974
Route schedule indicates next stop...

120
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,642
...Sin City.

121
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,227
I want access
to every surveillance camera

122
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,730
Vegas has turned on.
Check office buildings,

123
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,692
warehouses, restaurants,
department stores.

124
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,902
Look in sewer systems
if you have to.

125
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:21,905
ATMs! Freeman Street
and Main to be exact. 12.45pm.

126
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,241
Bank records indicate

127
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,580
they withdrew... the entire
contents of the machine.

128
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,289
Fifteen thousand dollars.

129
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,084
And also...
they never used a card.

130
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,587
They never even touched
the machine. Not once.

131
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,341
These EBEs possess
some extraordinary skills.

132
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,427
Bingo! Here's the cab
company security camera.

133
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:46,139
Keep your eyes on the
back door of the cab.

134
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:50,058
Right there.

135
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,395
Synchronous satellite feed.
Get me a licence plate.

136
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,899
Ground transport, now.

137
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:59,778
And no matter what they appear
to look like, gentlemen,

138
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,613
they're not children.

139
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,698
They're not even human.

140
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:23,301
Are your parents gonna be OK
with you guys spending all this money?

141
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,470
We have previously agreed
upon a financial deal.

142
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,639
If your concern is
regarding compensation...

143
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,807
My concern is that I got
a couple of kids

144
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,519
in the back of my cab
with a big wad of cash,

145
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,395
with a drop-off location that's
in the middle of nowhere.

146
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,817
In my book, that's a little
chapter called "running away. "

147
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,653
Jack, you better be getting
desert miles on that fare.

148
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:44,697
And they better be able to pay.

149
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,325
And you better get me an ETA!

150
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:49,118
I'm losing reception, Dominick.

151
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,452
Jack? Jack!

152
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,578
Come on!

153
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:58,001
Jack Bruno, the vehicles behind us
are indicating a pattern of pursuit.

154
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,294
No vehicles following...

155
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:05,176
At your rate of speed,
they will overtake our vehicle...

156
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,427
Relax, kid. I'm just
gonna let them pass.

157
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:20,942
Open road, people!
It's all yours.

158
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,380
What'd I tell you?
Nobody's following us.

159
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,716
- I'm the king of these roads...
- Jack Bruno!

160
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,356
I said I was out, and I meant it!

161
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:03,735
Who is Mr Wolfe, Jack Bruno?

162
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,820
How do you know that...?

163
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,572
Get down, now!

164
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,849
Hold on.

165
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:44,024
He is just a cab driver, right?

166
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,408
Jack Bruno, it would appear
we have not eluded them.

167
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,202
I'm so over this.
Stay down! Stay down!

168
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:58,914
Seth, no. It's not a good idea.

169
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,042
- I have to try.
- It's too dangerous.

170
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,216
Look out!

171
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:25,399
Now what?

172
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,368
Get out! Get out!

173
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,371
Get out!

174
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,005
You two OK?

175
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,923
- We are...
- Fine.

176
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,926
We should just keep moving.

177
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:57,514
You guys stay here.

178
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,350
You didn't get the message?

179
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:02,437
I told Frank and Marty I was out.

180
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,147
You tell Wolfe that
he's gonna pay for my repairs.

181
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:08,817
You are in way over your head here.

182
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,035
I want a complete profile on the driver.

183
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:20,371
- You think he's collaborating?
- Either way, he's a liability.

184
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,414
Get me some air transport.

185
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,503
How are you two
holding up back there?

186
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,049
- We are fine.
- I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

187
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,926
There's no need for you to apologise.

188
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:37,055
You're not always the one to blame.

189
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,557
But the urgency of our trip
has not decreased.

190
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,809
Don't worry. I'll get you two
where you need to go.

191
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,770
You've earned it.

192
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:09,002
- We're here, Jack Bruno.
- Here? There's nothing here.

193
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,346
Somebody's expecting you two, right?

194
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,516
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

195
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,603
Don't worry, Jack Bruno. We'll
soon be reunited with relatives.

196
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,775
OK. Seven hundred and 20
dollars and 50 cents.

197
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:34,194
But after everything that went down,
how about I knock off 25 percent?

198
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:35,822
- Here.
- I also...

199
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,078
OK, then. Goodbye to you, too.

200
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,500
Five hundred percent tip?

201
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,127
That's reasonable.

202
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,138
Hey! You guys overpaid!

203
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:03,891
By a lot!

204
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,150
Unbelievable.

205
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:27,498
Everything OK in there?

206
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,025
Hello?

207
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:16,672
What just happened?

208
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,175
You should not have
jeopardised your life by following us.

209
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,053
What sort of trouble are you in?

210
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:25,013
Return to your vehicle. Your
services are no longer required.

211
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:27,016
- He's trying to help.
- We don't need help.

212
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,101
Somebody's already been
here looking for it.

213
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,770
We simply cannot trust any of them.

214
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,521
Just us, Sara.

215
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,817
We appreciate your efforts
to assist us, Jack Bruno.

216
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,197
But my brother is right.
We can involve you no further.

217
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,031
- Got it!
- Let's go!

218
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:46,410
- Hey. Just tell me what's going...
- This way.

219
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,496
Hurry up, Sara.

220
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,387
What is that?

221
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,480
Hey!

222
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,364
Don't go in the
pimped-out fridge, Jack.

223
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,990
Hey!

224
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,067
What is this place?

225
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,278
This way.

226
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:05,423
Sara, it's here!

227
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:38,707
What is it?

228
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,419
It is what we came for, Jack Bruno.

229
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:44,422
Really? Is anyone else looking for it?

230
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,549
Say, the person who trashed
everything upstairs?

231
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,426
We think so.
It is very valuable,

232
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,636
which is why it was vital
we locate it first.

233
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,723
What makes you sure whoever else
wanted it isn't still looking for it?

234
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,106
Go. Go. Go.

235
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,526
Go.

236
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,833
Run! Run! Run!

237
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,305
- Jack Bruno!
- Kids!

238
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,107
Go, Sara!

239
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,990
Come on.

240
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,415
Jack Bruno!

241
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:48,045
Seth!

242
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:09,066
Come on! We gotta go!
We gotta go!

243
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,502
Seth!

244
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,552
- Seth!
- Keep moving! Keep moving!

245
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,766
Go, go, go, go!

246
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,775
Let's go! Let's go!

247
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,875
Get in!

248
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,817
How's your brother doing?

249
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,903
- His system has the ability...
- I will be fine.

250
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,572
It is important we gain much
distance from this location.

251
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,449
I'm happy you're feeling better,

252
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:42,992
you're gonna need
your strength when you explain

253
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:44,952
just what happened back there!

254
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,672
Here's the deal...

255
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,008
The cab doesn't move
until your mouths do. So start talking.

256
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,179
The information you are seeking is not
within your grasp of understanding.

257
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:05,516
We are dealing with issues
outside the realm of... your world.

258
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,058
Hey, I'm a cab driver, OK?

259
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,019
I have had plenty of worldly experi...

260
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,439
Experiences.

261
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,109
Sara! We have to go!

262
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,281
What is it?

263
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,119
Hang on!

264
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,500
Hold on!

265
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,494
We can't let him destroy it, Sara.

266
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,333
Who is he? And this time
I need real answers.

267
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,669
- It's a Siphon.
- A what?

268
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,755
an assassin trained
to pursue his target

269
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:19,757
until his mission is completed.

270
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,384
And his mission is?

271
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:26,846
Us.

272
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,747
Is there a safer route, Jack Bruno?

273
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,335
Not unless you know how to fly.

274
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,770
Get down!

275
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,448
Jack Bruno!

276
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,999
Come on, come on.
Hold it together!

277
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,836
Come on!

278
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:23,547
Faster! Faster!

279
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:26,008
It won't go any faster!

280
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,634
Sara!

281
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,730
Hold on!

282
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,699
Watch out!

283
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,922
Jack Bruno. In and out ofjuvie
and state pens since he was a kid.

284
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,673
Grew up poor in Midland, Texas.

285
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,760
Showed promise cutting his teeth
driving demolition derby and dirt track.

286
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,430
Ironically, at age 16,
his parents died in a car wreck.

287
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:15,682
At 17 he ran away
from his foster home

288
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,228
and he headed to Las Vegas in the hopes
of going from stock car to NASCAR.

289
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:24,732
Instead he found work as a wheelman
for Andrew Wolfe, the Vegas crime boss.

290
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,861
His last bust was two years ago,
grand theft auto.

291
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,696
He got out, went legit, and he's
been driving a cab since.

292
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,865
Spoke to Jack Bruno's boss
at Yellow Cab.

293
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,576
Bruno took a fare a significant
distance out of the city.

294
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,872
Dispatcher claims he's been unable
to make contact for hours.

295
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,790
Does the cab have a tracking device?

296
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,460
LoJack. It stopped
transmitting 28 minutes ago.

297
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:47,130
For some crazy reason, the last
location was on train tracks.

298
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:57,098
- No. We cannot trust him.
- I know we can, and we must.

299
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,564
Couple of kids, big wad of cash.
What could go wrong?

300
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,825
- You're frustrated, Jack Bruno...
- No.

301
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,451
No more "Jack Bruno this,
Jack Bruno that. "

302
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,996
I've been asking for answers...

303
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,747
You know the answers, Jack Bruno.

304
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,750
My brother and I are
indeed not from your planet.

305
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:28,672
That's it? So that's it?
Mystery solved?

306
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,090
You two want me to believe
that you're aliens?

307
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:32,259
It is the truth.

308
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,177
Really? Well, you don't
look like aliens.

309
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:37,305
What does an alien look like,
Jack Bruno?

310
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,017
You know what aliens look like.
Little green people

311
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,311
with antennas and laser guns and,
"Take me to your leader, Earthlings. "

312
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,107
You require some sort of proof.

313
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,317
He thinks we're insulting
his intelligence.

314
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,028
You think? You just can't drop

315
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,865
the "we're aliens" bomb
just like that on somebody.

316
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,075
I know I've seen some
pretty weird things today,

317
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,493
but you can't expect me
to believe that...

318
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,213
I have the ability
to move objects with my mind.

319
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:13,507
- That's impossible.
- No, it's quite possible.

320
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:15,385
On our planet as well as yours.

321
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:18,512
You don't. You haven't learned
to use your full brain capacity.

322
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:22,559
No, I don't do it
because it's kind of creepy,

323
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,811
and I really would like you to stop.

324
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,568
Jack Bruno!

325
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,367
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on!

326
00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:42,496
Come on!

327
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:48,001
Come on! Start! Start! Start!

328
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:12,108
Train engineer
is banged up but alive.

329
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,610
Last thing he saw in the tunnel

330
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:17,780
was our taxi and a set of flying lights.
Figured it must've been a small plane.

331
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:19,324
Small plane?

332
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:22,827
You think there's a chance
there's a second ship?

333
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:25,038
You have the ability to fly
at the speed of light,

334
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,706
yet you use a beat-up cab?
I don't think so.

335
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,335
Secure the site.
Catalogue every piece of debris.

336
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:34,880
I want to know what's train,
what's cab and what's left.

337
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:14,045
- Hello! Anyone here?
- Yeah, we're closed!

338
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,380
There you are.
I know you're closed,

339
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,842
but we've experienced
car trouble, I was hoping...

340
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:21,927
Still closed. Experience your
car trouble when we're open.

341
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:25,056
I'll work on that next time.
But this time I need you...

342
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,849
Jack Bruno.

343
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,853
The thing that will convince
Eddie Cortez to reopen

344
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:31,813
will be a significant amount of money.

345
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,858
Wait a minute. Do I know you?

346
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,652
Absolutely not. You don't
know them from anywhere.

347
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:41,155
I'll pay you double your rate.

348
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,949
- Why not triple?
- Done.

349
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:50,373
Did you get in a fight
with a rhinoceros?

350
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,753
- Poor rhino.
- Poor rhino! I know.

351
00:36:57,547 --> 00:36:59,715
I don't even know where to start.

352
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,092
Where you could start
is replacing the front shocks

353
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:04,721
and the tie rods, patch up
the radiator, fix the exhaust,

354
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:07,431
and if you have four tyres,
I'll take those. You got one hour.

355
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,744
Come on.

356
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,628
Over here.

357
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,755
Sit. Sit down.

358
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:50,432
I hope you do not act upon your
thought of making a fast break

359
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,603
out of the back door of Ray's,
escaping Stony Creek,

360
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,273
never to look back at us again.

361
00:37:56,356 --> 00:37:57,440
How do you know that?

362
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:01,068
My sister also has telepathy.
She can read minds of those nearest her.

363
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:02,152
Really?

364
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:05,990
Tell your sister that here, on Earth,
reading minds: very rude.

365
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:07,867
Don't do that.

366
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,911
Hey, guys. Welcome to Ray's.

367
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:13,331
My name is Tina,
and I'm gonna be your server.

368
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,293
Look at the two of you.

369
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,586
What do you mean,
look at the two of them?

370
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:23,757
They look like just two regular,
innocent all-American kids.

371
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:27,387
Who look like they rolled around
in a pigpen right before dinner.

372
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,597
- Evening, Tina.
- Sheriff Antony.

373
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:31,141
Your table's waiting for you.

374
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:33,434
I'm gonna send you
a round of Frito pies.

375
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:35,394
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, Tina.

376
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:40,065
Why don't the two of you come with
me, and we'll get you cleaned up?

377
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,818
Hurry back.

378
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,163
- It's Jack.
- I've been trying you all night.

379
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:55,873
Where are you?
You drop that fare yet?

380
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,626
No, it's really, really
complicated right now.

381
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,255
Uncomplicate it.
I want my cab back. Spotless.

382
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,134
Dominick, I gotta go. I gotta go.

383
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,514
- Got him! Stony Creek.
- OK. Get us ground transport.

384
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,724
I want a clean extraction
in 20 minutes.

385
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,356
You know, I think it would be...

386
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,983
Best for everyone if Seth
and I found another ride?

387
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:25,820
Seriously, you gotta stop doing that.

388
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,157
It is understandable
that you are scared and confused,

389
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,077
- considering all that has occurred.
- I'm not scared.

390
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,704
Just a little confused.

391
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:39,708
But, the bottom line is,
you guys need someone from NASA

392
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:43,045
- or the Air Force, not me.
- If you abandon us now,

393
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,215
our mission will be
in serious jeopardy.

394
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:48,092
Look, I'm just trying
to be honest here, OK?

395
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,637
- I'm the wrong guy.
- A wise human once said,

396
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,306
"You are what you think you are. "

397
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,391
Why don't you find
that guy and ask him?

398
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,396
It was the Buddha.
He's unavailable.

399
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,148
How is it that beings on your planet
can be so large in form,

400
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,025
yet feel so small inside?

401
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,407
Maybe you need help, too, Jack Bruno.

402
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,621
- Dominick, I told you...
- Are they safe, Jack?

403
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,088
- Who is this?
- My name is Henry Burke.

404
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,548
I work within the
Department of Defence.

405
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:30,342
I handle their more...
sensitive cases.

406
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,010
What do you mean, "sensitive?"

407
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,764
I suspect we both know
the answer to that question.

408
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:38,726
They're just kids. They don't
want trouble, and neither do I.

409
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,438
Good. Then we're on the same page.

410
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,106
Trouble is the last thing
I want as well.

411
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,943
But what I do want,
and I'm counting on you

412
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:51,614
to help me here,
are your two passengers.

413
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:55,952
What are you gonna do with them?

414
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,036
Do you care this much
about everyone

415
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:01,958
that gets into your cab?
You're a convicted felon, Jack.

416
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:05,628
You've spent most of the day
breaking one law after another,

417
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,838
for what, for them?

418
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,802
- What do you want me to do?
- Not make a scene.

419
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:16,472
You walked them into Ray's,
you can walk them out.

420
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:17,764
I'll take it from there.

421
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:20,559
And to show my appreciation
for your trouble,

422
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,394
I'll wipe your slate clean.

423
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,315
Just walk away, huh?
No harm, no foul?

424
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,233
That's right. Just walk away.

425
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,280
You've got five minutes, Jack,
and then it's all over.

426
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,864
Five minutes. See you then.

427
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,666
I don't trust him.
Cover all the exits.

428
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,965
They're here for us, aren't they?

429
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:55,594
Yeah. They are.

430
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,556
- Knew we couldn't trust him.
- Excuse me?

431
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:01,266
- Too late. We have to run!
- Wait.

432
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:04,436
I was wondering what your town's
policy is regarding firearms.

433
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:07,148
- Excuse me?
- There's a lot of guns coming in.

434
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,155
Come on. Come on.

435
00:42:17,742 --> 00:42:19,661
I think he's over here.

436
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:37,844
Can I help you boys out?

437
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:40,889
Official government business.
Excuse me.

438
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:44,476
Officially my town.
That makes it my business.

439
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,358
Mr Carson.

440
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,751
You're making a big mistake, sheriff.

441
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:10,085
I'll take my chances.

442
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,380
Dude, I told you I should have a gun.

443
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:15,340
Now might not be the best time
to bring that up... dude.

444
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:19,512
This is not good.

445
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,853
Follow me.

446
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,902
Up there.

447
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:39,364
OK.

448
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,952
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

449
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:52,128
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

450
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,061
It's locked from the outside.
We got to find another...

451
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:09,936
Hey, hey, hey!

452
00:44:15,693 --> 00:44:18,070
Or we could do that,
whatever that is.

453
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,239
My brother has the ability to
control his molecular density

454
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,784
which allows him to
phase through solid objects

455
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,911
or withstand the greatest of impacts.

456
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:30,166
That's neat. Real neat.

457
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:36,505
You've got some mighty big friends
in some mighty big places.

458
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,173
You check out.

459
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,449
Hi, little fella.

460
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,670
We appreciate your understanding.

461
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,632
Let's go.

462
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,887
We got an open hatch
leading to the roof.

463
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:27,597
We're on our way.

464
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,561
Eddie! Time's up. We gotta go.

465
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,981
Go? I still have a lot
of work to do on her.

466
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,445
Next time we're in town,
we'll make an appointment.

467
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,489
- You want my card, or...
- No.

468
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,213
Taxi's on the move.
I want every escape route locked down.

469
00:46:00,298 --> 00:46:02,592
I want that cab and everyone in it!

470
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:04,092
Too many of them to outrun.

471
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:11,516
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

472
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:31,369
Say goodbye to Stony Creek!

473
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,625
What?

474
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,043
No, no, not now! Come on!

475
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,713
Sara. Sara, are you doing this?

476
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:46,635
Sara, I said...
Absolutely not!

477
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,554
This junkyard is not going with us.

478
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,891
I am done picking up stray passengers.

479
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:09,157
Those guys chasing us were
the ones from the highway, right?

480
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:10,242
Yes.

481
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,494
It is vital you take us to their base.

482
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,414
You want me to take you
to the guys trying to kill you?

483
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,666
Let me explain
how we do things on Earth.

484
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,168
People who want you dead, you avoid.

485
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:23,922
That way you...
stay alive. Make sense?

486
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:28,177
No one on your planet will stay alive
if we do not return to our planet.

487
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,512
In order to return, we need our ship.

488
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,432
Those men who were trying to kill us
have stolen our ship. Make sense?

489
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:41,190
Where do you suggest
we begin our search?

490
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,192
I don't suggest we begin
searching at all.

491
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,362
I suggest we go back to Vegas
and I drop you off where you got on.

492
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:48,572
You, too.

493
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,034
Just as I thought.
No human is gonna help us.

494
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,369
Especially not this human.

495
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,498
Hey. Easy on the
human-bashing, OK?

496
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,625
Some of my best friends
happen to be human.

497
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,960
Even if I helped, I wouldn't
know where to begin.

498
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,338
I don't know anything
about UFOs or aliens or...

499
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:06,923
Who's Dr Alex Friedman?

500
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,637
She's actually
somebody who can help.

501
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,974
And, for the record,
she happens to be human.

502
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:23,023
No sign of the taxi from anyone yet.

503
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,818
Extend the search. They're out there.

504
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,829
Sara.

505
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,541
He would appreciate you pulling over
so he can relieve himself.

506
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:42,918
We don't have time.

507
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,378
He should've went
before we left Stony Creek.

508
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:47,547
He isn't pleased with your attitude.

509
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:49,300
Really? Is that the way he feels?

510
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:53,512
You remind him that
I'm a man and he's a dog.

511
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,724
And I'm not about to have this
or any conversation with a dog.

512
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,478
So my answer is still no.

513
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,197
Junkyard says thank you.

514
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,284
Did he, now?
Is there anything else he wants?

515
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:20,206
Oh. He said he would love
a bone or a meaty treat.

516
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:23,125
Top of my to-do list. Just get in.

517
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:20,349
Hey.

518
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,601
I need you to keep the cab close
and give the dog some water.

519
00:50:23,686 --> 00:50:27,231
And... give him a meaty treat.

520
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:36,282
OK. So stay close to me, don't
talk to anyone, nice and normal.

521
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:42,704
I'm telling you. He walked
right past me. Bad move.

522
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,875
This was captured by
a far-imaging telescope

523
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:50,003
at the University of Bonn
less than 48 hours ago.

524
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,797
What I want to direct
your attention to is this.

525
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:58,721
- That looks like a smudge.
- Yes. Yes, it does.

526
00:50:58,804 --> 00:50:59,972
Was it a spaceship?

527
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,057
- Did they abduct you?
- Excuse me?

528
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,893
- Were the aliens the Greys?
- Or the lizard people?

529
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,688
What? No, I wasn't
abducted by anyone.

530
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,023
How do you know?
Dr Harlan's last book

531
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,318
was all about how the aliens can
erase your memory with probes.

532
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:15,570
- Donald Harlan's book?
- You may have been probed.

533
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,740
It's pure science fiction.

534
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:20,909
I am talking about science fact here,

535
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:24,038
hard data, not crop circles.

536
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:26,748
Have you ever actually
been inside a crop circle?

537
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,043
I have. It was huge.
It's where the mother ship landed,

538
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:34,422
where they took me on board,
where I was married to an alien woman.

539
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:37,259
That is it. I will not
answer any more questions

540
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,222
about alien abductions,
crop circles or Dr Harlan.

541
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,599
Is that clear? If we could just
get back to the matter at hand.

542
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,684
People, hello, excuse me.

543
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:49,230
I promise it will be worth it.
The blue nebula.

544
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:53,858
We got a hit on Bruno's licence plate.
They're back in Vegas.

545
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:57,737
Attention. The foundation
has been rescheduled...

546
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,577
The cattle mutilation lecture doesn't
start for an hour. But grab a seat.

547
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,123
This place will be packed. It always is.

548
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:10,041
We're here to see you, actually.

549
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,585
It's Jack Bruno. We met earlier.

550
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,420
We did?

551
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:18,134
Cab... airport to hotel... driver.

552
00:52:18,217 --> 00:52:22,387
Oh. The nonbeliever.
What are the odds?

553
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,389
Is there someplace we can talk?

554
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,393
Are the... crowds in here
making you uncomfortable?

555
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,228
Even more private than this.

556
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,148
Look, no offence, but I'm pretty busy...

557
00:52:32,231 --> 00:52:35,818
She's doubting her thesis on Gliese 581
and Alcubierre's warp drive.

558
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,239
How did you know that?

559
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:42,324
It gets a lot better. Trust me.

560
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:47,704
- Are you insane?
- I thought you, of all people,

561
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,498
would understand and want to help.

562
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,501
Because I'm the nutjob
speaking at the UFO convention?

563
00:52:52,585 --> 00:52:56,172
- Don't answer that.
- I know it sounds really crazy.

564
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:59,175
Ya think? Hey.
Please don't touch that.

565
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,177
You captured an image of our ship.

566
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,347
The smudge? You're telling me
you think the smudge is your spaceship?

567
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:08,766
No, we don't think it's our spaceship.
We know it is our spaceship.

568
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,936
That's it. I'm out.

569
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:14,023
If you'll excuse me,
I'll grab my laptop...

570
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:33,083
They can also do all this stuff, too.

571
00:53:37,338 --> 00:53:38,338
Who are you?

572
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:41,007
Show her.

573
00:54:22,007 --> 00:54:25,094
This is... huge.

574
00:54:25,177 --> 00:54:27,846
I have so many questions,
though you are the answers,

575
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,806
here, standing right in front of me.

576
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,938
I'm sorry. I'm very excited. Right.

577
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:39,275
Where are you from?

578
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,027
Our planet is located some
3,000 light-years from Earth.

579
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,447
Space travel of such sizable distance...

580
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:48,617
Using a paradoxical passage in the...

581
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,952
Wormholes. That's it.

582
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,454
My presentation at SETI
National Convention was right.

583
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:56,500
Interstellar travel
is possible using wormholes

584
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,251
as a shortcut through space.

585
00:54:58,335 --> 00:55:00,713
That was my first guess
as well, the wormholes.

586
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,673
Continue, doctor.

587
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,804
- Why did you come to Earth?
- Our planet is dying.

588
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:10,639
Millennia of neglect has rendered

589
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,891
- our atmosphere unbreathable.
- Familiar.

590
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,184
Our parents are scientists
who have studied Earth's

591
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:17,730
climates in hopes of finding
a solution for our planet.

592
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:19,606
Our people's fears began to rise.

593
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,818
Our parents discovered something
our leaders were interested in.

594
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,822
Your planet makes a suitable
living environment for our kind.

595
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:31,827
It would be simplest to abandon our
dying planet and... occupy yours.

596
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,163
Wait. I'm helping you
conquer my own planet?

597
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:37,750
No. Most of the people on our planet
are fiercely opposed to this plan.

598
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,835
Fear of extinction
triumphed among our people.

599
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:41,503
But our parents
discovered a solution.

600
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,382
An experiment at an outpost here
was successful in regenerating life

601
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,675
into all previous
dying plants and trees.

602
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,929
Which would enable the re-oxygenating
of your atmosphere.

603
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,681
- So what's the problem?
- Our military.

604
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:56,018
They preferred invasion over science.

605
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:59,688
Which is why we had to hurry
and retrieve the experiment.

606
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,731
All proof that our planet can be saved,

607
00:56:01,815 --> 00:56:04,360
and your planet spared, is in here.

608
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:07,320
- Where are your parents?
- They were arrested.

609
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,197
We agreed to complete
the task for them.

610
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:13,534
- What about the assassin?
- Assassin? What assassin?

611
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,996
The Siphon warrior series
Deranian 75 was created by our military.

612
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:19,666
- They're bred to hunt?
- Bred to kill.

613
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:23,128
If we don't return back home in
time, the invasion will proceed.

614
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,632
We seriously need
to find your spaceship.

615
00:56:33,972 --> 00:56:35,807
How well do you know this guy?

616
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:39,061
We've done panels and debates
together on opposite sides.

617
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:41,646
But no one knows
the shadow world of

618
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,900
UFO government conspiracies
better than Harlan.

619
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:47,985
Not now, Whitley.

620
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,447
Well, hello, Dr Friedman.

621
00:56:51,532 --> 00:56:53,867
So you've finally decided
to accept my offer

622
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,077
of a romantic
Benihana dinner for two.

623
00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:59,206
- Huzzah!
- What?

624
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,251
Three years ago,
a screening of the Cooper footage.

625
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:06,422
You were in the fourth row, second seat,
in a saucy flower print.

626
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:10,092
Sorry, I keep my work and social
life separate. I don't date...

627
00:57:10,175 --> 00:57:13,762
- ... colleagues.
- Colleagues. Indeed.

628
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,556
Listen, we need to see
Harlan right away.

629
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:20,101
Dr Harlan is presently
unavailable for consultations.

630
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,186
We're qualified to answer questions.

631
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:23,605
There is no time for that.

632
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,192
It is a matter of life and death
that we see Harlan now.

633
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,943
Life and death...

634
00:57:29,027 --> 00:57:32,572
Uber scary drama queen theatrics.
What's the 411 sitch?

635
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:36,702
You're currently alive. Unless you
take us to Harlan, you'll be dead.

636
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,581
- We should...
- Together if you want to. Right now.

637
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,003
Go away!

638
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:51,090
The book signing is not till 4.30.
Read the brochure.

639
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:53,217
Harlan, it's Alex Friedman.

640
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,059
Dr Alex Friedman.
Quelle surprise.

641
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:04,980
We have to speak with you
immediately. It is important.

642
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,489
So you're saying the three of you
witnessed this reported UFO crash.

643
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:15,157
- Right.
- We were wondering if

644
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,242
there was any intel
amongst your sources.

645
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,954
I hate Iying.
I really don't like Iying.

646
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,248
I can tell when people are Iying to me.

647
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:28,003
But, thankfully, your story checks out

648
00:58:28,086 --> 00:58:32,090
with all the reports I got
from SETI and NORAD and NASA.

649
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:36,844
We have reason to believe government
operatives recovered the spacecraft.

650
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:40,139
OK. Back up a little.
This is not space camp.

651
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:42,434
Let the experts do their work.

652
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:46,521
You're very lucky, you two,
that you didn't come face to face

653
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,273
with the aliens who were in that craft.

654
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:54,195
They're like deadly praying mantises.
They eat your flesh.

655
00:58:55,322 --> 00:58:57,282
Yes, we are, indeed, lucky kids

656
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,827
not to have had our
flesh eaten by the aliens.

657
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:04,373
You got that right. OK.
Let's go to work here.

658
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:08,543
I got an e-mail from a source
that sent me this sat-grab.

659
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,088
Where would they take
the spaceship? 51? Nellis?

660
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,630
Wright-Patterson?
Vandenberg?

661
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,467
From the size and scope of the crash,

662
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,219
I would say there's
only one possibility.

663
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,887
- Witch Mountain?
- Witch Mountain.

664
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:22,139
What, are we a singing group here?

665
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:24,393
Let me talk, and you guys nod a bit.

666
00:59:24,476 --> 00:59:27,061
- I apologise. I'm sorry.
- Witch Mountain.

667
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,565
Let's take a look.
Here we go. California.

668
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,402
About 50 miles
from the border of Nevada.

669
00:59:33,485 --> 00:59:37,239
And it's one of our
top-secret facilities.

670
00:59:37,322 --> 00:59:39,907
I got a schematic here someplace.

671
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:42,827
If you're planning on visiting, don't.

672
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:46,539
When I say this place is
fortified up to the yin yang,

673
00:59:46,623 --> 00:59:48,708
I'm making an understatement.

674
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,420
Here's the schematic.
And do you have the book?

675
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,090
- Yes, I do.
- All right, then,

676
00:59:55,173 --> 00:59:56,882
here's an aerial view.

677
00:59:56,967 --> 01:00:00,304
Thank you, Harlan,
for everything.

678
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,347
Whatever trouble you're in...

679
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:05,891
...trust no one.

680
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,032
Thank you, both of you.

681
01:00:20,115 --> 01:00:23,117
Seth and I understand you don't
have to go forward with us,

682
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,246
- and yet you choose to.
- You're welcome.

683
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:31,251
And don't worry. We're gonna
get you home. I promise.

684
01:00:31,335 --> 01:00:34,713
I'm gonna grab my stuff.
Let's meet upstairs at my booth.

685
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,300
- Then we get your cab.
- Alex... listen.

686
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,635
- I can't let you come with us.
- What?

687
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:43,262
If what Harlan says
is true, it's too dangerous.

688
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:45,806
They got in my cab.
They're my problem.

689
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:49,143
No. I have spent my entire
life preparing for this moment.

690
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,896
Now, when I have two actual
aliens in need of my help,

691
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,148
you want me to walk away?

692
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:56,108
It's not gonna happen.
Man up, soldier. I'm in.

693
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,153
Just lay low till we meet up.

694
01:00:59,237 --> 01:01:02,490
Sure. Great. Lay low. Easy.
How hard could that be?

695
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,494
She thinks you're handsome.

696
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,831
- Really?
- And smarter than you think you are.

697
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:13,793
She was thinking about me?

698
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,380
At least as much as
you were thinking about her.

699
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:21,342
She didn't happen to mention
in her thoughts that I was...

700
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,052
It's showtime, everybody!

701
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,306
Space Expo Number Nine.
It's upstairs. Come on.

702
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,726
- Should we go upstairs now?
- Yeah. Let's go upstairs.

703
01:01:35,065 --> 01:01:37,900
Do you think she was
thinking about...?

704
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,697
Seth. Sara! Seth!

705
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,699
- Jack.
- I tried to warn you, Jack.

706
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,867
Mr Wolfe doesn't
take rejection well.

707
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:52,748
This is so not a good time.

708
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,501
You're out of time, Jack.

709
01:01:55,585 --> 01:02:00,507
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the Rebel Alliance cab driver scum.

710
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:04,052
Not such a tough guy out
of your ship, are you, womp rat?

711
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,804
You're in our house now!

712
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:13,811
Move! Move!

713
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:19,985
Hi! I'm Sunday.
Welcome to Planet Hollywood.

714
01:02:20,068 --> 01:02:22,570
Are you gentlemen here
for the UFO Space Expo?

715
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,155
Wouldn't miss it.

716
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:30,119
Seth! Sara!

717
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:39,336
Costume's great, man.

718
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:45,969
Seth! Seth!

719
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,012
Sara!

720
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:54,643
Seth. Sara.

721
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,730
I'm sorry.

722
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:10,494
I sure hope we have enough fuelage
to get back to planet Earth, Conrad.

723
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:13,329
Fear not, Celeste.
We must get to the ship.

724
01:03:18,043 --> 01:03:19,460
My leg!

725
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,713
No! Look at that beast
from another galaxy.

726
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:24,340
It's so disgusting and scaly!

727
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:27,594
- Didn't I tell you to stay by my side?
- I heard you the first time.

728
01:03:27,677 --> 01:03:30,262
Is this an important
piece of Earth's history?

729
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:33,891
- Stand back, you beast!
- No. Come on. We gotta go.

730
01:03:36,394 --> 01:03:37,561
Jack Bruno.

731
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,864
Sara!

732
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:55,413
Let's go! Let's go!

733
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,333
You're down!

734
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,253
Everybody, down!

735
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,922
Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!

736
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,007
Get down! You, down!
Everybody, down!

737
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:08,717
You with the blue hair, right there!

738
01:04:08,802 --> 01:04:12,264
Best... convention... ever.

739
01:04:12,347 --> 01:04:13,889
Not here! Move out!

740
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,242
Other way. Other way.

741
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,231
Sara, are you listening
to what I'm thinking?

742
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,197
Go! Go! Move it, move it!

743
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,657
Keep going! Keep going!

744
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,579
That's me.

745
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,753
Gotta go!

746
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,340
- What happened to laying low?
- Who lays low in Vegas?

747
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:33,052
Move, move! Get out of the way!

748
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,137
Move it! Get out of my way!

749
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:28,273
We got them! Our suspects.
No one else interferes.

750
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:31,318
Do not move! Do not move!

751
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:36,032
Stay inside the vehicle!
Hands where we can see them!

752
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:41,036
Greetings, Earthlings.

753
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,192
I didn't imagine they'd actually
look human, much less like kids.

754
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,110
They're lucky you joined us, doctor.

755
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,530
We're lucky... you joined us.

756
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,742
Luck has nothing to do with it.
It's pure science.

757
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,954
Chaos theory, the underlying
order in apparently random data.

758
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:26,166
So more like fate?

759
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,543
Science. Think about it.

760
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,670
What are the odds that they would crash

761
01:07:31,755 --> 01:07:33,965
near Vegas during a UFO convention?

762
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,050
I got in your cab.
Then they got in your cab.

763
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,510
And now we're all
in Harlan's mobile home

764
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,891
loaded with his intel on
where their ship is. That is not luck.

765
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:46,311
That is a predetermined order of
how things work in the universe.

766
01:07:46,394 --> 01:07:48,771
Have you always been this positive?

767
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,356
I have always been
a searcher for answers,

768
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:55,445
though my folks would say
I was merely a daydreamer.

769
01:07:55,528 --> 01:07:59,949
- How about you?
- Me? I'm a... much easier book to read.

770
01:08:01,409 --> 01:08:03,869
All my life my answers
have been "yes" or "no. "

771
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,498
Zero gray areas.

772
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,668
Where does the Mustang fall?
A yes or a no?

773
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:13,420
That's not just any Mustang.

774
01:08:13,505 --> 01:08:17,175
That's a 1968 Ford
Mustang GT 390 Fastback.

775
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:20,386
Steve McQueen's car in Bullitt?

776
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:24,140
- You've never seen Bullitt?
- No.

777
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:28,228
It's currently a no.

778
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:31,064
But one day I'm gonna earn
that car, the honest way.

779
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,484
And then it will be my yes.

780
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,988
- Jack?
- What's up, pal?

781
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,658
Are we there yet?

782
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,453
- "Are we there yet?"
- Unbelievable.

783
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:48,622
Good in any universe, apparently.

784
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,707
- Well, Alex?
- Yes.

785
01:09:08,226 --> 01:09:09,644
The maps are 30 years old,

786
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,854
but they're the best intel we've got.

787
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:15,399
Looks to be about five miles
from here to the entrance.

788
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,609
OK.

789
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,194
Let's rock and roll.

790
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,635
There's gotta be another entrance.

791
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,686
If the map's right,

792
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,230
there are several service
tunnels spreading outward.

793
01:09:55,315 --> 01:09:57,149
- Worth looking for, right?
- Let's go.

794
01:10:00,069 --> 01:10:01,362
Jack...

795
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,155
Sara. Sara.

796
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:04,782
Sara!

797
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,033
Seth!

798
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:13,875
Mr Bruno and,
I believe, Dr Friedman.

799
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:16,586
- What did you do to them?
- Consider yourself lucky.

800
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,463
I could have had you both shot
on sight for trespassing

801
01:10:19,547 --> 01:10:21,798
in violation
of US government property.

802
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,386
Sara!

803
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,899
There you go. All right.

804
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:42,654
Sir. With all due respect,
you have to listen to me.

805
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,989
They came in peace.
We cannot respond with violence.

806
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:48,033
The future of Earth depends on it.

807
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:51,246
It is absolutely vital
that they get home.

808
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:55,416
They are home, Dr Friedman.
They are now in my custody.

809
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,753
"Custody?" You can't expect to keep
them prisoner and get away with it.

810
01:10:59,837 --> 01:11:03,173
- They have rights.
- They're illegal aliens on US soil,

811
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,261
without so much as a passport.
The Patriot Act enables me

812
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:09,221
to detain them for
as long as is necessary.

813
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:11,265
You can't keep this quiet.

814
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:15,103
The world has the right
to know that they exist.

815
01:11:15,186 --> 01:11:18,314
And you're going to be the one
to blow the whistle, doctor?

816
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:23,694
A failed astrophysicist fired by three
universities for obsessing over UFOs

817
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,613
teams up with an ex-con in
declaring that the government

818
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:29,951
has captured two normal-looking kids
and is holding them hostage

819
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:33,787
inside a mountain that doesn't exist?

820
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,498
It would be so much easier
to let you speak

821
01:11:36,582 --> 01:11:40,712
than to deal with all the paperwork
involved with killing you.

822
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,922
- Someone will believe us.
- From behind bars?

823
01:11:44,007 --> 01:11:46,801
Let me remind you, Mr Bruno,
as a convicted felon,

824
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:50,805
you're looking at 20 years just for
standing on this mountain talking to me.

825
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,055
Shall I go on?

826
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,726
No. I get the message.

827
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:00,814
Smart man.
Give them a lift back down.

828
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,652
What? That's it? It's over?

829
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,573
I'm sorry. I will not go back to prison.

830
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,074
Let's go.

831
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,667
Thankfully Seth and Sara didn't have to
witness how quickly you gave up.

832
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:24,005
I told them it was a suicide mission,
and I wasn't wrong.

833
01:12:24,088 --> 01:12:25,840
They trusted you. I trusted you.

834
01:12:25,923 --> 01:12:28,842
Join the club of everybody else
who I've disappointed.

835
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:31,845
They will dissect them
like frogs. You know that.

836
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,805
It's not my problem and it never...

837
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,682
Hey!

838
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,993
By the way, that slap, very realistic.

839
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:56,996
When did you know?

840
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,957
You haven't bailed on the kids yet.
Why start now?

841
01:13:06,506 --> 01:13:08,632
How soon until
the subjects are prepped?

842
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,259
They're heavily sedated.

843
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:14,305
Minimal med tests proceeding
within 48 to 72 hours.

844
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,975
Unacceptable.
Commence the procedure.

845
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,228
We don't know enough
about their systems.

846
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:23,021
Any sudden change
could terminate the subjects.

847
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:24,649
You can't just kill them.

848
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:28,319
Mr Pope...

849
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,030
You would do well not
to forget what our mission is.

850
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:34,074
Our orders come from Washington,

851
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:38,078
and Washington wants answers
to some very complex questions.

852
01:13:38,162 --> 01:13:40,414
Our goal is to provide those answers.

853
01:13:40,498 --> 01:13:45,002
Now, if you are
doubting your ability...

854
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,463
No... sir.

855
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,470
Very good, then.
Commence the tests, Mr Matheson.

856
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,305
Right away, sir. Initiating tests.

857
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:07,608
- Here. Here.
- Coming... Almost...

858
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:19,203
- After you.
- I'm right behind you.

859
01:14:20,872 --> 01:14:21,872
Thanks.

860
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,722
- Back up. Back up for a second.
- What?

861
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:04,916
It's gonna be OK. I'm gonna
be here the whole time.

862
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,752
I'll be right below you
the whole time.

863
01:15:09,712 --> 01:15:10,837
- I can.
- You can.

864
01:15:10,922 --> 01:15:15,009
- Here I go. Oh, boy.
- That's it. Right here.

865
01:15:18,095 --> 01:15:20,096
- You got it.
- Here we go.

866
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:23,893
What's that?

867
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,854
Oh, no, Jack. Exhaust furnace!

868
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:31,859
This way. Come here. There's
another tunnel right here.

869
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,323
Hurry!

870
01:15:54,048 --> 01:15:55,966
- You OK?
- Yeah.

871
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,970
OK. Let's go.

872
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,956
What now?

873
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:30,917
- Find the kids. Don't get caught.
- Good plan.

874
01:16:31,002 --> 01:16:34,671
We're very close to determining
the source of their powers.

875
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,429
Yes, sir, containment
is at a hundred percent.

876
01:16:41,512 --> 01:16:45,265
We've recovered the two targets
and their spacecraft.

877
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:53,064
I understand. Thank you, sir.

878
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:55,859
And thank you for sticking
by me and the project.

879
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,029
I know it's taken
a long time to get here,

880
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,657
but we both agree it's been
worth our previous failures.

881
01:17:07,538 --> 01:17:10,123
All vitals appear to be stabilised.

882
01:17:13,502 --> 01:17:15,212
Attention, all personnel.

883
01:17:15,296 --> 01:17:18,131
South perimeter is now closed off.

884
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:20,967
South perimeter, closed off.

885
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:27,557
Stand by, all departments,
for re-check of radiation.

886
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:37,984
Whiskey 7, we have penetration in fence
sector 28. Break. Tango 31.

887
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:39,487
All stations, general alert.

888
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:42,198
Bruno. Deadly force authorised.

889
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,992
Project Moon Dust troops,
meet me in Sector 2.

890
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,118
Red alert, security breach!

891
01:17:47,203 --> 01:17:49,579
Red alert, security breach!
Red alert!

892
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,936
This facility's on red alert!

893
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:19,150
- Bravo Team, follow me!
- Attention! Attention!

894
01:18:19,235 --> 01:18:22,320
Go, go, go! Move!

895
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,240
Incoming!

896
01:18:29,787 --> 01:18:33,123
Fall back! Fall back!
Get those men out of there!

897
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:37,461
Hi. Can I borrow that pen?

898
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,430
I have three older brothers.

899
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:56,020
Sir, this area
has been compromised.

900
01:18:56,105 --> 01:18:59,734
- Make sure the blast door's sealed.
- Seal it off!

901
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,235
We got an Alpha Level 1 breach
in the main complex.

902
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:03,570
All units, respond!

903
01:19:03,654 --> 01:19:06,573
Isolate, lock down
and secure your sectors now!

904
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,829
- Keep moving! Keep moving!
- ... communication with Sector 5!

905
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,479
Come on, come on. Wake up!

906
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:55,331
We are under attack. I repeat,
all levels have been compromised.

907
01:19:55,414 --> 01:19:58,958
- We are under attack.
- Sir? Sir!

908
01:20:00,503 --> 01:20:02,712
- What was that?
- No idea.

909
01:20:02,797 --> 01:20:04,965
It's cutting down our troops,
driving for...

910
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,469
Straight for the lab!
Let's go! Move! Move!

911
01:20:08,552 --> 01:20:09,804
Let's go! Clear out!

912
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,398
- What is it?
- Some sort of anaesthetic.

913
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,442
- Can you fix it?
- I don't know, but I can try.

914
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:27,279
These locks are too strong.

915
01:20:27,363 --> 01:20:30,824
- Green is oxygen...
- We got to hurry. We got to hurry.

916
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:31,908
All right...

917
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:35,203
Can't get 'em open.

918
01:20:44,922 --> 01:20:45,922
Seth.

919
01:20:46,757 --> 01:20:49,510
Seth, it's OK. It's OK.

920
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:04,649
I'm gonna get you out of here.

921
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,365
...use extreme caution.

922
01:21:19,164 --> 01:21:21,833
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

923
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,810
Let's go.

924
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,155
It's over there.

925
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:34,782
Oh, my...

926
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:44,291
- We have to hurry.
- Well, tell them that.

927
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,667
Good idea.

928
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,088
Wait!

929
01:22:57,721 --> 01:22:59,722
Excuse me.

930
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:02,225
Do you not hear the alarms?

931
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,145
Work in this sector
is to cease immediately.

932
01:23:05,229 --> 01:23:09,483
We have off-the-chart readings of
sodium hypochlorite, xenon, hydrazine,

933
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:12,444
and you don't want to know
how bad the gamma radiation is.

934
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:16,323
But you're gonna have to do
some serious scrubbing down.

935
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:21,412
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Who am I?

936
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,997
I'll tell you who I am.

937
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,791
I am your worst nightmare
at a court-martial, soldier.

938
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,501
You can either do as you're told,

939
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:32,131
or I can go tell Henry Burke
you disobeyed his direct orders.

940
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:35,175
Your call. Choose wisely.

941
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:43,141
I'm pleased to inform you personnel
have evacuated the ship's hangar.

942
01:23:43,225 --> 01:23:45,351
What are you talking about?
On whose authority?

943
01:23:45,436 --> 01:23:49,564
- Yours... sir?
- Get out of the way!

944
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:50,899
Let's go! Move!

945
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,238
Thank you.

946
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,240
We were having a hard time
figuring that part out.

947
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:53,420
- Jack...
- A brave but empty gesture, Mr Bruno.

948
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,338
They're just kids.

949
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:32,960
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

950
01:25:33,043 --> 01:25:35,378
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

951
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:46,305
- Go, go! Run! Run!
- Get inside!

952
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:47,807
Get after them!

953
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:50,310
Alpha, break left! Bravo, on me!

954
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,395
Go, go!

955
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,819
Cool.

956
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:07,118
Get this thing up in the air. Let's go!

957
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:14,792
Go, go!

958
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:30,893
Dude! I could really
use a gun right now!

959
01:26:30,976 --> 01:26:33,520
Thank you. This is a really big gun.

960
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:40,819
Come on.

961
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,913
- Activate the shields.
- Power at 25 percent and increasing.

962
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,460
No, no. No, no.

963
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:06,386
You do know how
to fly this thing?

964
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,305
- How do you think we got here?
- Well, you crashed. Remember?

965
01:27:14,895 --> 01:27:16,395
Siphon!

966
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:20,859
Hold on!

967
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,987
Got him!

968
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:29,909
Watch out!

969
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,497
Follow the tunnels.
There you go!

970
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,582
Lock down the mountain.

971
01:27:44,341 --> 01:27:45,591
Watch out!

972
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:48,845
Just shut it down!

973
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,390
Gates closing in ten,

974
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:53,600
nine, eight...

975
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,726
- Watch out!
- ... seven, six...

976
01:27:55,811 --> 01:27:58,229
- The door!
- ... five, four...

977
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,605
Go! Go!

978
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:02,024
- ... three, two, one.
- The door!

979
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,962
- You did it!
- We did it. We did it!

980
01:28:23,547 --> 01:28:24,881
What was that?

981
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,967
The airlock's jammed. I need to
manually override the system.

982
01:28:28,051 --> 01:28:30,761
You two fly.
Just tell me what to do.

983
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:04,171
Alex, it takes two to pilot the ship.
I need you to take the controls.

984
01:29:04,255 --> 01:29:06,547
What? Are you insane?

985
01:29:31,823 --> 01:29:33,324
Jack!

986
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,204
You're better with the mask on.

987
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,046
Jack!

988
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:46,021
Yes, he's here.

989
01:30:46,106 --> 01:30:49,109
Sir, it's Washington. They have
some questions for you.

990
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:57,576
Sir?

991
01:30:59,578 --> 01:31:01,246
You both must hurry.

992
01:31:01,329 --> 01:31:03,247
Only a matter of time
before they get here.

993
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:05,958
- Don't worry about us.
- Sara and I want you to have this.

994
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:08,627
As long as it's in your possession,

995
01:31:08,712 --> 01:31:11,506
we'll always be able to find you.

996
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:18,012
Thanks.

997
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,521
Your parents will be very proud
of what you've done here.

998
01:31:32,569 --> 01:31:34,404
Thank you, Alex.

999
01:31:38,033 --> 01:31:42,412
I once said that we could never count on
humans to help us. Especially you.

1000
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,998
I was wrong, and for that I am sorry.

1001
01:31:46,082 --> 01:31:47,708
You take care of yourself.

1002
01:31:49,377 --> 01:31:52,171
And your sister, too.
Do you understand?

1003
01:31:54,716 --> 01:31:56,926
- Yes.
- Jack?

1004
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,810
You guys remember that. Me and Alex,

1005
01:32:06,895 --> 01:32:12,484
we're only a wormhole away. OK?

1006
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:15,278
I want you to
promise me something.

1007
01:32:16,613 --> 01:32:18,823
Take care of Junkyard for me.

1008
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:22,284
Anything you want.

1009
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,336
It's time.

1010
01:32:33,797 --> 01:32:36,298
You're a good man, Jack.

1011
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:54,502
If everything that you wrote about
in your book is true,

1012
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,546
why risk coming out
in the public at all?

1013
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,090
Why haven't you been
arrested yet, or worse?

1014
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:02,594
We decided right away that
the more public we went with the story,

1015
01:34:02,677 --> 01:34:06,221
then the less likely
we were to... disappear.

1016
01:34:06,306 --> 01:34:09,600
And so far, clearly, we've been right.

1017
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:12,895
- Thank you all so much for listening.
- Thank you.

1018
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:19,819
Technically, I planned
the whole mission.

1019
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:33,667
A big nebula guy...
How's it going?

1020
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,377
- Hi, boys.
- Doctor.

1021
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:41,173
Jack! Jack!

1022
01:34:41,257 --> 01:34:44,010
Howdy, boys. How you doing?

1023
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:45,595
He touched me!

1024
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:50,100
Come back to us, please!

1025
