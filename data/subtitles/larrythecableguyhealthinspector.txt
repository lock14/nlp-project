1
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,939
Hey, what's going on, Donnie?

2
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,677
- Hey, Larry. You wanna play?
- You knoW What? I can't.

3
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,775
I'm late,
and I gotta get something to eat.

4
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,376
My boss is a dickweed.

5
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,753
Dickweed. Dickweed. Dickweed!

6
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,654
I'm okay.

7
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,919
I love that kid.

8
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,231
Dickweed!

9
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,161
Young man,

10
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,729
do you have
any freshly-squeezed orange juice?

11
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,944
I got your fresh squeeze
right here, grandma.

12
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,080
Who the hell do you think you are?

13
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:40,817
Name's Larry,
and I'm the health inspector.

14
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,182
Brother, you is out of business.

16
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,747
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,651
Hey, Jack Dabbs!
New job keeping you on your toes?

18
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,895
- Is that your idea of a joke, Larry?
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

19
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,590
I just thought...
You know, you're the new guy.

20
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,098
Hey, look, MoonPies.

21
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,761
It's the original
tasty marshmallow sandwich.

22
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,030
I'll give you pick of the litter.

23
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,368
Oh, yeah, sure.
Give the guy in the chair first dibs.

24
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,567
- No, I didn't mean it like that at all.
- Son of a bitch.

25
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,043
Let me help you. Hold on.
Let me help you get through here.

26
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,541
Oh, Larry,
Tatlock wants to see you right away.

27
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,647
Hey, what's up, Tattycakes?

28
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,719
I can't believe What I'm reading.

29
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,921
Oh, man, don't tell me gay bashers
are sending you hate mail again.

30
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,492
The city is being sued

31
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,527
for a damaged coccyx.

32
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,230
- You think that's funny?
- No, I don't think it's funny.

33
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,205
I'm crying on the inside, okay?

34
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,709
Once again, you've defiled and violated

35
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,506
the very citizens
you've sworn to protect.

36
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,173
You weren't even working under
the jurisdiction of this department.

37
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:21,117
Nobody writes out more code violations
than me, Larry.

38
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,882
And nobody leaves a bigger trail
of destruction in their wake.

39
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,514
Well, it's about time
I'm getting recognized.

40
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,718
I'm not giving you a compliment.

41
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,161
You know, since I can't babysit
your inbred hillbilly ass 24 hours a day,

42
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,823
I've decided to assign you a partner.

43
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,334
A partner?
Now, come on, you know I Work alone.

44
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,505
I drive alone, I inspect alone,

45
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,373
sometimes I'll even have sex alone.

46
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,340
But never on company time.
That's my policy.

47
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,247
- Anyway, I work alone.
- Not anymore.

48
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,345
Butlin!

49
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,152
- You called me in, sir?
- You gotta be kidding me.

50
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,985
First I lose my promotion
to the pissed-off crippled feller

51
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,257
that's only been here three weeks,

52
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,664
and now you expect me,
a man of my tenure,

53
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,066
to work With a dadgum boy.

54
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,865
I'm Amy Butlin.

55
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,770
So your parents gave you a girly name
to toughen you up. I like that.

56
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,872
I've been very eager
to be part of a collaboration

57
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,848
ever since I graduated
from the Academy.

58
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,045
Really want to get out in the field and...

59
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,358
You ever fart so hard your back cracks?

60
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,424
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

61
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,867
Good Lord Jesus
and Dale Earnhardt Jr.

62
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,337
I am a dadgum ticking time bomb.

63
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,105
That's my partner?

64
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,644
Seriously?

65
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,714
Good luck.

66
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,648
Larry?

67
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,585
Larry, I figured I'd drive.

68
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,156
With gas prices where they are

69
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,195
and American dependency
on foreign fuel at an all-time high...

70
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,461
Hey, Butlin, get in a real vehicle.

71
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,162
Hell's that thing run on?
StraWberry douche?

72
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,700
Park it.

73
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,152
What are you doing?

74
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,187
Hey. whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey! what are you doing?

75
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,655
I was throWing these items
into your external cargo bay.

76
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,056
Number one,
it's gonna blow out, all right?

77
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,288
And number two,
it's making my truck look trashy.

78
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,432
Butlin, this is the Larrymobile.

79
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,391
You respect the Larrymobile.

80
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,528
Now, I don't want you moving nothing
or touching nothing

81
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,130
without the express written consent
of me, Larry.

82
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,004
We clear?

83
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:02,611
- Respect the Larrymobile. Got it.
- Climb in.

84
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,183
Come on, son.
You act like you're 90 years old.

85
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,754
Let's go clean up the town.

86
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,695
NoW, if you don't mind, Larry,
I Would actually prefer shadowing you

87
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,831
from the other side,
from the food prep area.

88
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,876
That way I can take notes
and observe your procedure.

89
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,412
- All right, Butlin, you go ahead.
- Okay.

90
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,518
Morning.

91
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,118
This fish is raw!

92
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,350
What are you trying to do,
poison these folks in here?

93
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,703
- Larry!
- Sakamoto! How you doing, buddy?

94
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,931
Very fine.

95
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,905
But you look good.
You been Working out?

96
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,500
- Pushups.
- Well, you do look good.

97
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,007
You try blowfish. Rare delicacy.

98
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:16,353
Tell you what, I'd rather dip French fries
in my grandma's bedsores.

99
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,214
I don't mean to interrupt,

100
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,055
but may I bring up
Subpart 4-501 of the Food Code?

101
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:26,291
Believe me,
if Sakamoto made it, I've brought it up.

102
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,157
I'm referring specifically
to the part about

103
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,326
Warewashing Process Evaluation.

104
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,098
The accepted procedure is to expose
a securely-tied remote probe

105
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,833
of a thermocouple or the sensor
of a Well-shielded maximum

106
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,275
registering at least 4.8 on the scale.
So, if We could possibly go back...

107
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,936
- Butlin.
- Yes. What?

108
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,514
You ain't gonna believe this,
but there's a snoW cone vendor

109
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,414
- out there not wearing a bra.
- What?

110
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,146
Is that a violation?

111
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,347
No, but it makes me
wanna get a snoW cone.

112
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,416
Just watch that guy.

113
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,276
What the hell is that?
Smells like deer urine.

114
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,351
It's not deer urine.
I have sensitive contacts.

115
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,813
- Hey, you want a MoonPie?
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

116
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,555
I've got a whole glove compartment
full of them.

117
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,058
I can see that.

118
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,368
- What are you doing?
- I found a buyer for these.

119
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,306
Do you know
how many $400 bottles of wine

120
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,674
we have gathering dust back here?

121
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,271
Would you prefer offering
our customers wine by the box?

122
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,181
I would prefer you don't run
our mother's restaurant into the ground.

123
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,278
Well, honey, the All City Top Chef
is in a feW days.

124
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,291
If we win, we'll be fine. I told you that.

125
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,661
You also told me
I could start bartending or waitressing.

126
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,961
- That never happened.
- well, I mean,

127
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,900
you know, being in charge of security
is a big responsibility.

128
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,740
- You're ashamed of me.
- No. Oh, don't be ridiculous.

129
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,642
You wanted me to lose Weight,
and I went on Atkins.

130
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,648
You wanted me
to dress for success, and...

131
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,882
Okay. You know what? You're right.

132
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,413
I'll tell you what.

133
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,453
Once we get through the All City,

134
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,421
we'll talk about expanding your role
at Micelli's.

135
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,388
That's my girl.

136
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,503
Hey, let me ask you something.
You think you could make me

137
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,637
- one of them fancy head deals?
- Sure.

138
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,342
Please, Larry, try our chicken dhansak.

139
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,353
- Chicken dans-what?
- It is one of our popular dish.

140
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,618
You don't want me eating that
next to an open flame.

141
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,492
Do you noW, or have you
to the best of your knowledge,

142
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,964
ever had an infected Wound
containing pus,

143
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,500
such as a lesion or boil
on the hands or wrists?

144
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,869
And has this infected Wound
that may or may not contain pus

145
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:26,673
protected With an impermeable cover
such as a finger cot or a...

146
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,075
Larry, what...

147
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,876
I'm reporting you for that.

148
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,353
Oh, come on, Butlin.
That immigrant food ain't that bad.

149
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,651
You deliberately impeded
my line of questioning.

150
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,556
You undermined me
and made it impossible for me

151
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,786
to carry out my duties.

152
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,261
You didn't see any health hazards
in there.

153
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,424
What you seen
was a bunch of hard-Working people.

154
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,300
Now, they may not know how
to speak English good, like what I do,

155
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,736
but they ain't doing anybody
no harm, either.

156
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,810
So I sometimes let them slide
on the small stuff,

157
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,809
and they take real good care,

158
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,744
and then I never have to bust them
on the big stuff.

159
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,476
And your thoughtless actions
resulted in the loss of my contact lens,

160
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,882
which means noW I have to go back
to LensCrafters to replace them,

161
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,249
and the mall is noWhere near...

162
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,241
Damn it, Butlin,
respect the Larrymobile.

163
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,894
Lord, are you okay?

164
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,765
Are you all right?

165
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,908
Listen, these mannequins,
it's not your fault.

166
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,445
- They are not very limber.
- Oh, God.

167
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,679
The ones I got at the house, you can
barely get the leg up over the ears,

168
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,943
and they just snap off like a tWig on...

169
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,519
Well, I don't do that.
My cousin does that.

170
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,079
Nice work, Jane. Very creative.

171
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,854
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

172
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,656
Yeah, well, you did.

173
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,026
And enough
With your lame apologies, okay?

174
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,760
- I mean, you sound like a broken record.
- Hey, Wait a second.

175
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,597
She had nothing to do
with them chest baskets

176
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,069
- hitting the floors.
- "Chest baskets"?

177
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,406
- Boulder holders.
- "Boulder holders"?

178
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,303
Look, I could do this all day.

179
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,272
The point is,
you gotta buy these and test-drive them

180
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,473
before you put them on.

181
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,879
I mean,
you don't wanna get one, get home,

182
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,883
make your titties all cattywampus.

183
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,647
Good Lord,
makes fellers cross-eyed and whatnot.

184
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,189
- It ain't Christian.
- Right. I'm gonna have to ask you

185
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,088
to vacate the premises, sir.

186
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,925
You hold on a second there.

187
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,394
I'm the health inspector,

188
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,329
- and what we got here...
- Is not food-related.

189
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,560
Well, that depends.

190
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,502
According to the C-section
of the Penile Code,

191
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,302
a lot of these edible underbritches
need to be refrigerated.

192
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,673
Sir, get out.

193
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,273
Out.

194
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,019
I'm really sorry.

195
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,398
Excuse me.
Hey, excuse me, ma'am? Excuse me.

196
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,562
- Hey. I'm Larry.
- I'm Jane. Jane Whitley.

197
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,070
Jane, are you okay?

198
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,107
I didn't cause you any trouble in there,
did I?

199
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,302
Yeah, well, I just got fired.

200
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,346
But when you think about it,

201
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,643
I did kind of deserve it, really.

202
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,308
Don't tell me I got you fired.

203
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,908
- No.
- Oh, thank God.

204
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,081
She said I was lazy and irresponsible

205
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,556
and unreliable.

206
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,684
Well, those sound like
the story of my life, too.

207
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,319
Larry, where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

208
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,126
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, I didn't mean to interrupt.

209
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,463
I'm not an impeder. This is my partner.

210
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,096
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- Not like partner-partner.

211
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,367
Not like gay partners.

212
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,642
He works under me.
We... No, I mean... Damn it.

213
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,714
You're always butling in.

214
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,645
That's kind of funny.
Your last name's Butlin,

215
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,742
so, you see, you're kind of butling in.

216
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,619
It's a joke.

217
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,087
- Big Shug made the Top 10.
- I know.

218
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,394
That All City Top Chef's a big deal.
They's a lot of restaurants in that.

219
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,733
You know, started With 300.
300 pretenders, but only one king.

220
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,199
I'm gonna tell you,
I'm pulling for you, Shug.

221
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,435
You knoW I am. You know why?

222
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,274
'Cause you dream big,
just like your name. Big Shug.

223
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,747
Just so you knoW, when I win,
I ain't gonna forget my friends.

224
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,886
Right. I already forget all my friends,
and I ain't never Won a damn thing.

225
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,194
You knoW What I'm gonna do
with that $250,000?

226
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,165
- Hopefully get me four new truck tires.
- Nope.

227
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,237
Man, come on, Shug.
Hook a brother up, playa.

228
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,167
No. I'm gonna open up Big Shug's
all across the country.

229
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,741
- Finally get Whitey off my back.
- Let me ask you something.

230
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,836
Why you gotta call us "Whitey"
all the time?

231
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,380
I mean, that's pretty racialistic.

232
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,950
He ain't white.
That's my landlord's name.

233
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,747
Whitey Johnson.
He just as black as me.

234
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,548
I'm just saying.

235
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,651
Tell you What, though,
you got some balls

236
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,886
getting in
that All City Big Chef tournament.

237
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,962
I mean,
they's some good restaurants in there.

238
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,292
You know who had big balls?
My grandpa.

239
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,892
He got stung by a bee
right doWn there in the testicular area.

240
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,530
Sumbitches swolled up.
I mean, they was infected.

241
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,242
Looked like he Was sitting
on a beanbag chair

242
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,174
every time I went over to his house.

243
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,743
We ended up getting him
a testicle tourniquet.

244
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,406
A testicle tourniquet?

245
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,711
- Yeah, a oyster catcher.
- Oyster catcher?

246
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,918
I can do this all day.

247
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,784
Larry, if you're done here,

248
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,348
there are a few items
that require your attention in the back.

249
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,491
Hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

250
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,001
I gotta take the BroWns
to the Super BoWl.

251
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,295
Hey, Larry, the men's room is out of TP.

252
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,034
This is all the butt-Wiping paper I need
right here.

253
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,491
- Thank you for your time.
- Sure.

254
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,895
Okay. Okay, bye.

255
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,978
Let me help you, Jack. Here we go.

256
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,448
NoW, see how we done that?
That's teamwork right there, buddy.

257
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,346
Appreciate you coming doWn.

258
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,785
Let me help you out With your beer.

259
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,255
Don't be an asshole, Larry.
My arms aren't paralyzed.

260
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,952
Hey, man, I'm just trying to help out.

261
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,331
So, how's that new partner
Working out for you?

262
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,294
Don't even talk about Butlin.

263
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:08,431
I promised myself tonight Butlin
is staying out of the conversations.

264
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,205
I'll tell you what pisses me off
about Butlin.

265
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,536
You ever see that program, Sesame Street?

266
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,974
Bert and Arnie, them little fellers.
You ever see them?

267
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,516
- Yeah.
- That was a team, all right?

268
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,948
They got all their Work done,
but yet they had dadgum fun.

269
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,583
Butlin is too uptight.

270
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,757
He's loud, he's gross, he's rude.

271
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,663
He urinated in a thermos
on the Way to an inspection.

272
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,998
I don't knoW. You think it might be
'cause of some freak accident

273
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,299
that Butlin Was born that way?

274
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,169
I don't knoW. I probably ought to be
a good Christian about it.

275
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,680
Here I am,
blessed With square-jaWed good looks

276
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,807
and firm, muscular buttocks
and good health.

277
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,909
That's the important one, good health.

278
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,648
Gotta have good health,
or nothing else matters.

279
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,681
Shame to have all that

280
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,317
and then Butlin's got this bug
that lives up his ass.

281
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,055
Just ain't fair.

282
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,331
You're talking to a guy
Who feels nothing from the waist doWn

283
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,095
about someone
having a bug up their ass?

284
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,695
It's not that he doesn't knoW
what he's doing.

285
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,773
I mean,
when there's a serious code violation,

286
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,569
he's quick enough to Write it up.

287
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,338
It's just that
he doesn't take the job seriously.

288
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,310
And it's a serious job.

289
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,547
Come on, let me help you out.
You haven't had a drink all...

290
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,175
- Jack, I'm just trying...
- I don't Want it.

291
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,015
Have a...

292
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,715
Now, look What you've gone
and done, Jack.

293
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,223
I didn't mean to do that.
I was just trying to help you out,

294
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,386
and you went and spilled it.
Now, just stand still. Oh, damn!

295
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,094
After lunch today,
he told me there Was a broWn snake

296
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,690
playing peek-a-boo With his butt hole.

297
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,928
I aced Bio. I do not recall broWn snakes.

298
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,740
Check it out.

299
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,944
I'm so glad We finally came here.
This place is so amazing.

300
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,372
The best is yet to come.

301
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,441
- I don't have room for dessert, Tad.
- I'm not talking about dessert.

302
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,783
Debbie Goldstein,

303
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,058
Will you do me the honor...

304
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,590
- Tad?
- What? That was the chair.

305
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,387
- Just the chair.
- Oh.

306
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,602
Debbie Goldstein...

307
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,336
Oh, my God!

308
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:25,936
Debbie.

309
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,748
Where's the ladies' room?
Oh, my stomach.

310
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,579
- Oh, God.
- God, that's disgusting!

311
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,847
Almost cleaned up.

312
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,016
My phone's ringing.
I'm gonna leave you these napkins.

313
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,387
Larry's the name,
health inspecting's the game.

314
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,223
Are you serious?

315
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,563
I'm gonna be doWn there.
Don't touch nothing.

316
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,807
Never mind.

317
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,036
Jack, I'm sorry.
I forgot that you Were still in there.

318
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,105
You want me to help you through these?
I'll help you. Okay.

319
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,774
Somebody take care of him.

320
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,358
- Incoming call.
- Butlin.

321
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,254
What?

322
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,260
Health inspector.

323
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,633
Nobody leaves,
nobody enters without my say-so.

324
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,003
NoW, we're gonna need
to cordon off the area... What the hell?

325
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,370
Excuse me, sir, We require a jacket.

326
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,647
Well, you're gonna require stitches,

327
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,082

328
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,246
I do have a reservation.
Fist, party of five.

329
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,231
Jane? I didn't knoW you speak Spanish.
That's pretty good.

330
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,303
Boy, you don't waste any time, do you?

331
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,305
Last time I seen you,
you Was up at the panty store

332
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,342
With your hands
all over a naked plastic Woman.

333
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,379
'Course, you could say the same thing
about me as well.

334
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,448
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

335
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,184
Hey, you're that woman from the mall.

336
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,352
Neat.
I'm gonna take some food samples.

337
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,363
Yeah, why don't you go
take some food samples?

338
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,561
She really is your partner-partner.
I just got that.

339
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,059
WoW.

340
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,106
WoW. Pretty and smart.
We do have a lot in common.

341
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,841
Don't you have an investigation
to conduct?

342
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,344
Oh, believe me, I'm conducting.
Believe me.

343
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,874
Butlin!

344
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,781
- To the kitchen.
- Okay.

345
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,479
Larry.

346
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,484
- What are you doing here?
- I'll handle this.

347
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,328
Boss, we was on-call tonight.

348
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,094
We got a call
about some farting JeWish folks.

349
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,223
We responded.

350
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,098
Also, I'm working on this little number
over here in the black skirt.

351
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,296
You're out of your league, numbnuts.

352
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,234
I tell you what.
Why don't you go over to Sizzler

353
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,832
and see if they got enough wet naps?

354
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,444
Yeah, that's hilarious.

355
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,652
- Come on, Butlin. We's off the case.
- What? Why?

356
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,415
Ask Tatlock.

357
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,327
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, God, not again.

358
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,521
Get a whiff of that. That smell familiar?

359
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,534
Yeah.

360
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,227
Yeah, it smells like the drops
I use for my...

361
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,769
- Shit!
- Excuse me?

362
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,838
Oh.

363
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,333
That's what happens When
you put eye drops in someone's drink.

364
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,602
It gives them the wicked shits.

365
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,647
I used to be a barmaid, and We'd do it
to customers Who stiffed us.

366
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,046
- Neat.
- Why are you still here?

367
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,811
Boss, listen.
I'm gonna tell you right now.

368
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,750
This might be a put-up job.

369
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,345
I think somebody's putting something
in the water around here.

370
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,651
The only thing
that's gonna get put up around here

371
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,093
is my foot up your ass,
if you do not leave immediately.

372
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,598
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,562
- But how about...
- An order.

374
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,435
- How about...
- Stop.

375
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,593
- If I...
- Don't.

376
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,672
I...

377
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,741
Oh, thanks. I knoW, it's the dry air.
I get boogers all the time.

378
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:28,251
No, no, no, that...
That was my phone number.

379
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,187
I kneW that.

380
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,924
I would be happy to look into that,
Ms. Micelli

381
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,795
Thank you, Mr. Mayor

382
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,227
- Vera?
- Yes, Mr. Mayor?

383
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:49,673
Yes, can you pull the file
on TWilight Moments Assisted Living?

384
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,607
I Wanna make sure I'm prepared
for the groundbreaking tomorroW.

385
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,042
Thank you.

386
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,420
I could jot down some talking points
on Medicare and prescription drugs

387
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,054
for seniors, if that would be helpful.

388
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,497
- Oh, no, thank you.
- All right.

389
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,093
It breaks my heart that we can't
help these old people anymore.

390
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,365
I know.

391
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,941
Your reservations are also confirmed
for tonight at Micelli's.

392
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,875
Oh, Micelli's. That...
My wife just loves the tiramisu.

393
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,945
It's delicious.

394
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,911
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Mr. Mayor?

395
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,482
- Maybe there is.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:35,280
Would it be out of line if I asked you
if you could just rub my shoulders?

397
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,649
Yeah, it kind of would.

398
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,588
Well, that's why I didn't ask you.

399
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,325
- If that'll be all.
- Yes, thank you, Vera.

400
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,828
- Thank you, sir.
- See you tomorroW.

401
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,695
What is her problem?

402
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,264
- I'm not happy.
- Oh, man, you got more letters?

403
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,801
Don't worry, boss,
they're just allegations.

404
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,708
I mean, look, you got a wife
that's semi-good-looking,

405
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,838
a couple squirrelly kids
running around the house.

406
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,813
I mean,
that spells "real man" in my book.

407
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,819
There were rat droppings
in the food at Clarito's last night.

408
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,752
NoW, that's our finest
five-star restaurant.

409
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,290
We've never had a complaint
about them before.

410
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,054
This comes chronologically adjacent
to last Week's incident

411
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,357
- at Les Deux Coquilles.
- Lay who where?

412
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,667
- The French restaurant.
- Your emergency call, remember?

413
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,928
Well, I remember me and the boy here

414
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,363
coming up With some hard evidence
of foul play,

415
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,736
but nobody paid us no mind.

416
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,674
For some incomprehensible reason,

417
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:37,146
the Mayor's office has requested
that you, specifically you,

418
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,342
be assigned
to investigate the Clarito's incident.

419
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,148
Like the song goes,
you must have friends in high places.

420
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,449
No, that's Friends in Low Places.

421
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,488
- Different song.
- Who sings it?

422
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,924
Look, it doesn't matter, all right?

423
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,794
I don't care what kind of strings
you pulled to get this gig.

424
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,995
ScreW this one up.

425
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,768
I'm begging you, Larry.

426
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:03,098
Did the rodent droppings
have any specific shape or form?

427
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,607
I have been Working 10 years
to build the reputation of Clarito's

428
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,440
into a nice, clean, respectable joint.

429
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,343
Look, believe me,
We sympathize, Chef Carmine.

430
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,848
I'm assuming you've never had
a rodent problem like this in the past.

431
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,351
Rats? Are you kidding me?
I mean, I'm mortified.

432
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,920
Well, guess what?

433
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,513
You got a whole nest of them,
big mothers.

434
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,227
Rattus norvegicus.

435
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,227
Norway rats.

436
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,389
Come over to this country from Europe,
I'd say around, oh, 1774.

437
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,731
But there's one thing that concerns me
about these here rats.

438
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:37,067
Every kind of rat, be it a seWer rat
or a field rat or a rug rat,

439
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,109
is basically a Norway rat.

440
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,678
I thought this rat Was the same
as in my bathroom,

441
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,543
regular big city rats.

442
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,408
However, there's one difference here.

443
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,652
Look at the turd-cutter on that thing.
Look at that.

444
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,813
It's too clean. It is too clean.

445
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,588
It don't stink. Nothing.

446
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:58,025
That only mean one thing.
That there is a lab rat, which means...

447
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,721
Someone planted these rats here.

448
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:00,855
- Exactly.
- Oh, boy.

449
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,456
Who Would besmirch
the name of Clarito in such a manner?

450
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,967
- Who?
- You got enemies?

451
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,730
I only have friends.

452
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,362
Former employees that are mad at you?

453
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,065
- No.
- Ex-wives wanna make you suffer?

454
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,199
No, nobody. No.

455
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,674
HoW about strippers that said
you'd buy them a neW pair of titties

456
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,507
'cause you said something
you shouldn't have said one night

457
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,604
when you was drunk in the bar
and then her boyfriend

458
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,649
threatened to kill you, so you had
to change your phone number,

459
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,185
- and even that didn't work...
- Larry.

460
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,687
Well, I'm just covering the bases.

461
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,285
This is your idea of evidence?

462
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,594
- "The rats' butts are too clean."
- That's right, Tatster.

463
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,454
Case is closed.

464
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:39,430
However, there's just two little,
teeny pieces of the puzzle we need.

465
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,169
Who done it and why?

466
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,569
This ain't some isolationist event.

467
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,206
- Here's what I think.
- I don't give a rat's ass what you think.

468
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,314
All right?

469
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,843
What is so damn hilarious?

470
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,942
You just said "rat's ass."

471
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,617
I mean, don't you think
that's kind of funny?

472
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:01,385
I mean, considering we was just talking
about rats' asses.

473
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,122
That is an amusing coincidence.

474
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,095
Out.

475
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,408
Get out!

476
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,505
What's happening?
Are We following up on a lead?

477
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,604
Did we make a break in the case?

478
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,910
If that break in the case
involves me getting some,

479
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,180
- We just knocked it Wide open.
- Getting some What?

480
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,846
- Oh.
- That's right.

481
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,620
Seems like your mentor and role model

482
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,963
just got himself a date With Jane,
the waitress.

483
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,431
I'm gonna take her down there
to the buffet at the bus station.

484
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,731
- Sounds romantic.
- Butlin, a man's got needs, all right?

485
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,329
I mean, you ought to know.
Hell, I seen you making goo-goo eyes

486
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,237
- at Big Shug.
- Excuse me?

487
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,005
Don't get all defenseless, all right?
I don't care if you sWing the other way.

488
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,673
I mean, come on, I'm not homeopathic.

489
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,513
Are you really taking her
to a buffet at a bus station?

490
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:06,681
I mean, take her someWhere special.
She'll never see it coming.

491
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,157
Keep burning the midnight oil, Butlin,
all right?

492
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,285
Leave the lady-killing to me.

493
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,240
Hey, Ironsides, I knoW you're busy.
I don't wanna interrupt you.

494
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,867
But, listen,
you're working the five-star beat, right?

495
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,775
You knoW,
the one with all the foreign menus

496
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,438
and cripple ramps and whatnot?

497
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,278
- Yes.
- I got a date with this girl Jane,

498
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,875
who's the creme de la creme.

499
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,979
And get this.
Butlin wants me to take her doWn there

500
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,456
to that buffet by the bus station.

501
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,822
- A buffet on a bus?
- Exactly. You believe that?

502
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,858
I wanna take her someplace nice
so she thinks I'm a classy guy.

503
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,195
Can you help me?

504
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,260
I'm not a miracle worker.

505
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,767
Well, obviously not.

506
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,736
If you was,
you'd have got up out of that wheelchair

507
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,774
and kicked my ass a couple weeks ago.

508
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,408
Seriously, I need something fancy.

509
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,816
- Yeah, I might knoW a place.
- Cool.

510
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,648
- Micelli's
- Hey, it's Jack Dabbs

511
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,723
- well hello Jack

512
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:16,156
My colleague Larry is coming in tonight.
Take care of him, okay?

513
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,057
I most certainly will.

514
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,201
Hi.

515
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,304
I can't believe
you got a reservation here.

516
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,397
I think it takes, like, months
to get a table.

517
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,966
Not that I would know.
I mean, I don't really get out that much.

518
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:37,104
Well, doors open
when you're with Larry.

519
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,315
HoW you doing, partner?

520
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,176
Listen, called earlier,

521
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:46,188
talked to François, Antonio,
something or other.

522
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,521
But they had saved me
a couple seats doWn here.

523
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,492
I don't think so, sir.

524
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:57,298
Well, I'm sure they did.
Can I look in your little fancy book?

525
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,161
Yep, there I am right there.

526
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,933
- That's you?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,376
- Denzel Washington?
- Yeah.

528
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,468
I own Denzel's Leaf and Lawn Service.

529
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,876
You knoW what,
you ought to come doWn there.

530
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,439
You look like a guy
that would appreciate getting bloWed.

531
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,019
Larry, it's okay.
We don't have to eat here. We...

532
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,985
- Larry, isn't it?
- Well, lookie here.

533
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,023
- It is so nice to see you.
- Mayor, hoW are you?

534
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,285
Actually, that's Denzel Washington.

535
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,684
HoW dare you?

536
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,922
This man
is a hardworking public servant,

537
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,260
and you have the audacity
to put him doWn like that?

538
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,266
I didn't. It Was him, sir.

539
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,696
Mr. Mayor,
please accept my sincere apologies.

540
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,331
- I'll take you to your table.
- I am sure you Will.

541
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,708
See you later. Come on, baby.

542
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,245
I'm so hungry
I could eat the butt hole out of a skunk.

543
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,524
I dropped my balls.

544
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,067
I'll get it.

545
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,269
Usually, a feller's balls don't drop
till he's 65.

546
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,462
Larry.

547
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,597
- Good evening. I'm Lily Micelli.
- Larry!

548
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,300
- Hello. Hi.
- What the hell?

549
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,399
How are you doing?

550
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,705
- Fine, thank you.
- Wonderful.

551
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:18,145
Larry, this is Lily Micelli, the owner.

552
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,409
- Miss Machiavelli, hoW are you?
- Very well, thank you.

553
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,250
You run a nice restaurant in here.

554
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,347
Let me ask you something.
Do you got one of them toilets

555
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,120
Where it shoots cold Water
up your crack?

556
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,098
When I heard that
a member of our Health Department

557
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,999
had been mistreated by one of our staff,

558
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,595
- I Was appalled.
- No, don't worry about that.

559
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,470
I wouldn't let myself in, either.

560
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,805
Not even if somebody
would've slipped me a fifty.

561
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,744
- Not even then.
- Oh, that's very generous of you.

562
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,611
NoW, I would really hope
that you would accept something

563
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,309
from our premium wine cellar.

564
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,353
Oh, boy, that's the fancy stuff. Yeah.

565
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,947
Fill her up.
You're living in the big time noW.

566
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,658
No wonder you're making money.

567
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,060
- Just taste the wine, Larry.
- Oh, yeah.

568
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,201
Boy, that is good.

569
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,410
I feel so comfortable with you.

570
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,547
You knoW what?

571
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,616
Other than my underbritches
creeping up on me,

572
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,150
I feel pretty comfortable
around you, too.

573
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,520
Oh, I probably
should have told you this before,

574
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,092
but I didn't think we'd...

575
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,025
- What is it?
- I...

576
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,394
I live With someone, sort of.

577
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,897
Boy, that figures.

578
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,469
A guy like me
doesn't end up With a piece...

579
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,632
Nice, wonderful, intelligent,
career-minded woman

580
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,367
such as yourself.

581
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,669
I kneW
there had to be a catch somewhere.

582
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,803
No, no, no, no. There's no catch.

583
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,473
- It's just...
- Well, what is it?

584
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,616
Okay, if I let you in,

585
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,248
you just have to promise
not to be judgmental.

586
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,593
Shoot, I have seen some twisted stuff,
all right.

587
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,562
Whatever you got going in here,
believe me, I can handle it.

588
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,326
I remember
one time I had a cottage cheese...

589
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,537
Larry, this is my mom.

590
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,933
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

591
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,837
"Nice to meet you, ma'am."

592
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,308
Mom, Larry works
for the Health Inspection Unit.

593
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,813
As what? A warning sign?

594
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,116
"Eat right, or you'll end up
looking like this piece of shit."

595
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,545
She's a little shy around new people.

596
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,559
Shy? Oh, man, I love sassy fat chicks.

597
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,792
Well,
look at this silver-tongued bastard.

598
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,299
Trying to sWeet-talk me
like I'm his third cousin.

599
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,508
Hey, Pabst Blue Ribbon.
My kind of girl, right there.

600
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,580
So,

601
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,121
hoW did you become a health inspector?

602
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,582
I mean, Working for the government,
it must be so exciting.

603
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,389
Well, I gotta tell you,
keeping people from blowing chunks

604
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,691
and crapping on themselves

605
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,130
is pretty much all I ever been good at.

606
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,397
I mean, nobody really knoWs
the responsibility I carry around.

607
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:30,565
But you must have dreams
and aspirations.

608
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,575
Boy, I gotta tell you,
I don't really have a lot of dreams.

609
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,970
Had one a couple weeks back
after I left the bar

610
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,914
- and had some of that skunky beer.
- Oh, yeah? What was it?

611
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,288
Big, giant woman
made out of MoonPies.

612
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:47,184
She looked a lot like Lulu
from Hee Haw.

613
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,253
I don't have that dream about her
no more, though.

614
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,058
No? Who do you dream about now?

615
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,134
Little bit smaller girl.
Looks a little bit like you.

616
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,332
In a MoonPie bikini.

617
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,343
Any chance you didn't hear that?

618
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,017
Listen, I apologize.
I gotta run to the toilet.

619
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,685
My stomach ain't felt this bad
since I had them fish sticks

620
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,124
out of the vending machine
at the Phillips 66.

621
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,458
It's doWn the hall,
the first door on your left.

622
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,758
I appreciate it.

623
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,033
Oh, damn.

624
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,698
- Is everything all right in there?
- Everything's fine. Everything's good.

625
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,705
Good Lord Jesus and his shepherds.

626
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,746
Are you serious?

627
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:16,206
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Might need a Shop-Vac in there,

628
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,780
but I'm doing pretty good.

629
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,350
Well, it's getting kind of late.

630
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,112
Yeah, but not too late
for a man and a Woman

631
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,982
to get to know one another.

632
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,556
Let me tell you something.
when I seen you through the window

633
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,954
doWn there at the panty store,

634
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:32,392
I said to myself, I said,
"Self, that's your someone, right there."

635
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,764
I bet that left a mark.

636
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,898
Sounds like you got something honking
for the right of way.

637
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,135
Larry, I think you should go.

638
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,636
Yeah, it is getting kind of late.
Maybe I ought to leave.

639
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,445
Okay. Nighty-night.

640
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,519
I'm gonna tell you something.
This ain't no coincidence.

641
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,991
I mean, this whole thing
has been planned and organized.

642
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:07,962
I wouldn't be surprised
if the sumbitch Was pre-medicated.

643
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,896
- What are you saying?
- The crimes.

644
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,060
I mean, it's the same mojo apperandi.

645
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,138
Evidently, somebody's got a grudge

646
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,208
against high-class,
hoity-toity restaurants.

647
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,142
Like a pressure group of angry vegans?
Or maybe it's PETA.

648
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,180
Damn it, Butlin, you mean to tell me
you knoW the name of the guy

649
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,976
and you haven't even told anybody?

650
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,442
It's People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

651
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,314
You're talking crazy talk now.

652
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:36,293
I tell you what, We get a reservation list
from all the poisoned restaurants,

653
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,054
We'll find our poisoner.

654
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,457
That's certainly one way to go,
but We do need a backup plan.

655
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,524
A backup plan?
Butlin, let me ask you something.

656
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,799
Did Patton need a backup plan
at Gettysburg?

657
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:49,964
Oh, God.

658
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,008
Did what-you-call-her
have a backup plan

659
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,805
doWn there at Custard's Last Stand
with the Mexican?

660
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,571
Or better yet, did my friend Donnie
have a backup plan

661
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,015
When he shaved his pubes
with a rusty kitchen knife?

662
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,349
Okay, no backup plan.

663
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,051
Glad we understand each other.

664
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,957
Okay, there you are.
Our entire database at your disposal.

665
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,433
Database. Right.

666
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,137
And my last month's reservations
are in a separate folder.

667
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,101
- Oh, cool, you got a folder.
- Yeah.

668
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,803
Right. Now, look,
I'll leave you here to your investigation.

669
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,346
I've got an appointment
with my crab supplier.

670
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,574
Yeah, I had an appointment With mine
a couple Weeks ago.

671
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,548
She denied everything.

672
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,422
I ought to be on Leno.

673
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,735
What the hell?

674
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,743
"Them handcuffs left a mark!"

675
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:09,846
Well, now.

676
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,685
What in tarnation?

677
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,557
Get a good look?

678
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,332
Mom, I didn't knoW you was here this...

679
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,270
I work here, all right?

680
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:31,068
I'm with the Health Department.
That's my badge right there.

681
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:35,111
Yeah? All right.
Maybe you are who you say you are.

682
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,438
And maybe you are who you said you...

683
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,314
What the hell are you, exactly?

684
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:47,349
I make sure
Micelli's is free of undesirables.

685
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,892
We have a lot in common, then.
Let me ask you something.

686
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:54,522
What do you find is the best way
to get rid of rat turds?

687
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,497
Take a walk, crumb cop.

688
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,303
She was so ugly,

689
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,969
she could have trick-or-treated
over the telephone.

690
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,104
I wasn't scared of her, though.
I was scared for her.

691
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,881
If she'd set me off,
I'd have come doWn on her

692
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:19,354
with one of them pile drivers, and then...
Nailed a bionic elbow on her.

693
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,487
What's a bionic elbow?

694
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,028
Oh, for Pete's sake,
don't tell me you don't watch wrestling.

695
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,790
Not so much.

696
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,764
Dadgum it, Butlin,
what kind of man are you?

697
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,569
I was unable to find any matches
between the reservation lists

698
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,138
at Clarito's and Les Deux Coquilles,

699
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,104
and you couldn't find anything
at Micelli's.

700
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,198
Oh, I found something, all right.

701
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:44,212
Found out old Lily Micelli ain't as prim
and proper as she makes out.

702
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,243
Yep, she's a regular Girls Gone Wild

703
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,183
with them dirty e-mail.

704
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,949
- How does that help us?
- I don't know hoW it helps you,

705
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:58,017
but it helps me in my decision
on getting one of them computers.

706
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,536
Larry's the name,
health inspecting's the game.

707
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,473
No. Are you serious?

708
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,906
Don't touch nothing. I'll be right there.

709
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,259
Hold on, Butlin,
make sure We got the right address.

710
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,387
Are you kidding me?

711
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,493
Now, Gaz, there's really nothing wrong.

712
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,467
- So a few people got sick.
- Just a few.

713
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,504
All right, all right,
so maybe some people vomited

714
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,594
- in the parking lot.
- "Vomited"!

715
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:43,764
Maybe there was something wrong

716
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,739
with the way the food was prepared
this evening.

717
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,403
Sod this for a game of soldiers.
I'm slinging me hook!

718
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,774
Now, Gaz, please.

719
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,280
Now, the All City
is just around the corner.

720
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,373
We went to great expense
to bring you here.

721
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,452
Butlin?

722
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,814
Looks like a casting call
for Zorro, the Gay Blade in here.

723
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,446
- Let's get out of here.
- I don't give a toss

724
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,760
about your poxy chef contest.

725
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,351
About your poxy chef contest.

726
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,893
- Well, yes, it's a very...
- Just sod off!

727
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,486
Think my buddy Big Shug
is gonna love this.

728
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,566
I cannot wait to call him.

729
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,329
These fancy restaurants
is dropping like flies.

730
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,868
Big Shug.

731
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,007
Who now has a chance
at winning the All City,

732
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,772
now that all the competition
has fallen victim

733
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,905
to mysterious outbreaks
of food poisoning.

734
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:28,678
Butlin, don't you even say
what I think you're fixing to say.

735
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,017
- Oh, the motive's right there.
- What, a pepper shaker?

736
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,856
It's right in front of your face,
and you don't wanna see it.

737
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,017
You wanna close your eyes
and pretend it's not happening.

738
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,389
That's what she said.

739
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:42,727
You think Big Shug can't possibly
be guilty because he's a friend of yours.

740
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,972
- You know how I spend my days?
- Not at the gay bar, that's for sure.

741
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,065
I spend them
reassuring the people of this city

742
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:56,374
that the outbreak of poisonings
is under control.

743
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,839
That the department's on top of it.

744
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,314
That people don't have to Worry

745
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,977
When they go out to eat
at their favorite restaurants.

746
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,953
Sir, We had a lead that we were
pursuing vigorously. Unfortunately...

747
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,489
Quiet, Butlin!

748
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,157
The only reason you're on this case

749
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,229
is to help me
get this gun-toting redneck fired.

750
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,696
"Gun-toting"?
wait a second, I ain't got guns no more.

751
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,926
I got rid of them
when Donnie broke into my truck

752
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,801
- and shot himself in the nuts.
- Donnie? Who the hell is Donnie?

753
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,964
He's my semi-retarded neighbor.

754
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,608
However, he might be full-bloWed
retarded. I ain't figured it out yet.

755
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,373
He's a good kid, though.

756
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,176
You knoW, I hear tell he just got a job
down there at the theaters,

757
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,717
ripping tickets and sWeeping floors
and whatnot.

758
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,947
- He's doing pretty...
- Shut up.

759
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,456
The city attorney tells me
you're one legitimate infraction away

760
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,085
from having your ass tossed out
on the street.

761
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,360
I want you to go out there
and bring me back results

762
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,231
Without breaking any rules,
or you're done.

763
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:56,966
End of story. End of Larry.

764
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:03,302
Using all my years of experience
on the health beat

765
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:07,372
and my intuition and ability
to follow the thought processes

766
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,577
of the criminal mind,

767
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,814
I Will now point to the next restaurant

768
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,050
on the poisoner's list.

769
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,864
So we go and tell the oWners
of the Office Kingdom

770
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,868
that a brilliant mixture
of science and mathematics

771
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,268
has determined
they're the next likely victims?

772
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:36,071
- We go and tell the Fatted Calf.
- That's it, the Fatted Calf.

773
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,046
But We don't.
We get an undercover agent to do it.

774
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,146
That's a great idea.

775
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,484
I'll do it.

776
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,191
Butlin? Listen, I don't knoW
how to tell you this, all right?

777
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:53,252
So I'm just gonna come out and say it.
You're not exactly undercover material.

778
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,762
At least, yet.

779
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,893
Butlin, imagine, if you Will,

780
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,096
We're in one of the nicest restaurants
in the city right here.

781
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:06,733
For sake of argument,
let's call it Le Larry.

782
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,373
Hello, welcome to Le Larry.
I'm Amelia, your server.

783
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,111
May I interest you two in a selection
from our wine cellar?

784
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,484
The '91 cabernet sauvignon
would be great.

785
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,057
- Good choice.
- Hey, Larry!

786
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,794
- Do you want to play?
- I can't right now, Donnie. I'm working.

787
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,329
Let's play!

788
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,596
- Oh, my God! Is he okay?
- I'm okay!

789
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,225
Attaboy, Donnie!

790
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,861
Yeah, don't worry about him.
He does that all the time.

791
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,305
Oh, remember when he... He got
in this fart contest a long time ago,

792
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,434
and they was... He was farting
a song, Jimmy Crack Corn,

793
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,512
and he got a little...

794
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,739
Larry, can we get back on point here,
please? Thank you.

795
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:45,815
Oh. Sure.

796
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,843
Well, look at the little feller
we got waitressing on us.

797
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:53,017
Hey, little feller.
Why don't you run and get us

798
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,648
one of them nice Boone's Farm Wines?

799
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,455
It don't matter what flavor.
We're not picky here at this table.

800
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,029
This is the stupidest thing I've ever...

801
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,429
Le Larry is a classy place, okay?
We don't serve Boone Farm.

802
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:04,659
Damn it, Butlin.

803
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,259
People been drinking
Boone's Farm Wine in this country

804
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:11,467
ever since the Lord cometh over here
on the Mayflower over 100 years ago.

805
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,806
Jane, I'm sorry you had to get involved
in this gigantic waste of time.

806
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,776
Larry, I have a case to work.

807
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,517
Come on, she Was trying.

808
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,020
Butlin. Butlin!

809
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,221
- What?
- I wanna tell you something.

810
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,689
You're raW. You is raW.

811
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,555
But you know what you got? Balls.

812
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:37,326
You got balls, and that's what it takes
to be a health inspector.

813
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,698
- Thanks, Larry.
- Damn right.

814
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:44,740
Butlin, I bequeath to you
this microphone cord and earplug

815
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:48,572
so you can go undercover
in the Health Department.

816
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:57,781
Test 2. Roger 9 to Butlin.
Butlin, is this on? Can you hear me?

817
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,481
Butlin.

818
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,455
Butlin, turn your microphone on!

819
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,318
- Testing, testing.
- All right, Butlin, listen,

820
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,558
you need to be a chameleon. Blend in.

821
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,998
Okay. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry about that.

822
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,071
One thing you do not want to do
is stand out.

823
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,139
Oh, God!

824
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,537
- Sorry.
- Butlin, good Lord, what happened?

825
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:23,073
Sounds like you're a bull
in a Chinaman's shop in there.

826
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,115
I had front-row tickets to Nugent,
and he wasn't as loud as you.

827
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,513
Shut up, Larry.

828
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,252
Hello, sir.

829
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,954
For tonight's specials,
We have sautéed trenne

830
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,955
with beef Bolognese,
peacock kale and parmesan.

831
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:46,195
Butlin, it's not Bolognese, it's bologna.

832
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:51,096
I understand you have
a particularly impressive squab.

833
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,572
Hey, Butlin,
he's checking out your package.

834
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,805
What did you do ?
Get a chubby when you went in there ?

835
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,813
Think about... Think about baseball.

836
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,685
Can't believe you're the only feller
who'd get a chubby on an undercover.

837
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,516
Damn it, I am a woman.

838
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,091
I have breasts.

839
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:11,126
They may not be especially large,
but they're perky,

840
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,219
and my nipples could cut glass!

841
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,199
What? No, no, no.

842
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,837
Oh, Mayor Gunn.

843
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,903
Don't beat yourself up, Butlin.

844
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,567
Undercover ain't something
you master overnight.

845
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,974
I remember one time
they sent me down there to Hooters

846
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,639
and had me acting
like a drunken, loud-mouthed slob...

847
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,080
- Larry, the Mayor's here.
- Where?

848
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,981
He just walked into the kitchen
with Chef Leon.

849
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,418
Butlin, Wake up and smell the cat box,
for God's sake!

850
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,890
- What are you talking about ?
- The Mayor! Don't you get it ?

851
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,620
Now he can see us at work.

852
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,094
Only we're gonna get a big promotion
for this.

853
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,957
- Monsieur, I cannot do this.
- Oh, of course you can.

854
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,932
It's just a little sprinkle here.

855
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:57,200
You're asking me to poison the food
that I took so long to prepare?

856
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,036
Oh, no, no, no, Chef.
Not at all, not at all.

857
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:02,202
If I do this, no one must ever know.

858
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,646
Thank you.

859
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,582
Larry, did you hear that?

860
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,455
Larry! Larry!

861
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:21,930
Excuse me. were you eavesdropping
on my conversation?

862
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,066
- No.
- Are you with the press?

863
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,135
No!

864
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:30,368
Sodomite! Sodomite!

865
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,964
You have brought shame to our family.

866
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,704
Flaunting yourself
in front of the imperialist sWine,

867
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:38,440
leaving me to do nothing
but fend for myself at the house

868
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,345
with nothing but a goat for company.

869
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,413
- You heard all that, right?
- Oh, I heard.

870
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,783
- You got it all on tape, right?
- I got it.

871
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,450
- So what are we gonna do?
- Oh, we're gonna nail the Mayor.

872
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:53,791
He is going doWn faster than a bottle
of Vicodin at Courtney Love's house.

873
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,665
I have died and gone to Larry heaven!

874
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,745
Look at that 10-point buck!

875
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,941
Congratulations, son.

876
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,347
I'd pat you on the back,
but you shot me in the neck.

877
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,113
A talking buck?
I ain't never seen nothing like that.

878
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,756
I even got my oWn jukebox.

879
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,884
Gonna play me a song.

880
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,330
Hot damn! Kid Rock!

881
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,762
I got the boat full of gas,
cooler full of beer.

882
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,568
Let's go kick some bass.

883
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,511
Good Lord, the Virgin Mary
and a grilled cheese sandwich.

884
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,546
I'm going fishing with Kid Rock.

885
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,310
Hey, Larry, sure you don't wanna
catch something a little hotter?

886
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:25,084
- Jane?
- Nice rod.

887
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,547
She said rod.

888
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,255
Got a major dilemma here.

889
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,357
One hand,
Kid Rock wants to take me fishing.

890
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,194
But on the other hand,
I got Jane, who's a girl,

891
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,327
and apparently wants to get naked
with me in a biblical Way.

892
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,837
Don't know what to do.

893
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,043
Gonna have to make this decision
on your oWn.

894
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,737
Come on, Larry. What are you, queer ?

895
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:53,340
- The deer makes a good point.
- He does at that.

896
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,979
- Come on, dear.
- Yes!

897
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,281
Not you. You.

898
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:20,103
Man, this is gonna be a good day.

899
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,877
I'm just saying
there's a case for exercising caution.

900
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,005
And I'm saying

901
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,607
there's a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon
right back there in the back

902
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,243
that I'm gonna open up
when we put the Mayor away.

903
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,288
And you knoW what?
You can't have any of it

904
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,154
if you keep talking
about gathering more evidence.

905
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,351
I just think that...

906
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,052
Here's what you need
to be thinking about.

907
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,858
You need to be thinking about
a cool little catchphrase to say

908
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,593
- When We get him.
- What do you mean?

909
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,191
Well,
you gotta have a cool catchphrase.

910
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,963
I mean, it's in the rule book.

911
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,302
Like that time
I busted that chef at the Golden Goose

912
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,367
for dealing drugs in the kitchen.
I said, "Your goose is cooked."

913
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,247
So what do we say to the Mayor?

914
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:02,117
"We're from the Health Department,
and we'd like to talk to you."

915
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:05,381
Tell you what, Butlin,
I'll handle the catchphrase.

916
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,392
How do you answer charges
that you've been an ineffective mayor,

917
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,687
that you've mainly devoted yourself
to finding ways

918
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,854
to contribute to your own bank account?

919
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:17,364
Well, everyone knows that
I'm a tireless campaigner for this city.

920
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:20,127
The people,
they know what kind of man I am.

921
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,225
Health Department!

922
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,703
- Sir, I tried to tell them...
- It's okay. I knoW these people.

923
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,037
Anything I could do
to help the Health Department.

924
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,507
- Let's get a picture.
- Picture?

925
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,407
You poisoned all them restaurants.

926
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,536
You know what you is?

927
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:34,139
You're a damn
restaurant-poisoning mayor.

928
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,419
We have evidence that you're behind
the incidents at Les Deux Coquilles,

929
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,147
Clarito's, Bottle and Micelli's.

930
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,189
Yeah, just what she said,
every one of them.

931
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,623
Evidence? Incidents?
I don't know what you're talking about.

932
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,091
Turn that thing off.

933
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,095
Don't know what we's talking about."

934
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:51,831
Maybe this little tape recorder I got
Will refresh your memory a little bit.

935
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,437
Oh, Larry, right there.
Right there, that's perfect.

936
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,096
You need it higher? I can go higher.

937
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,108
Oh, damn. wrong side.

938
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,473
- I cannot do this.
- Oh, of course you can.

939
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:06,310
It's just a little sprinkle here.

940
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,819
You're asking me to poison the food
that I took so long to prepare?

941
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,246
Leaves a bad taste in your mouth,
don't it?

942
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:15,919
Not as good as the Golden Goose,

943
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:17,219
- but pretty good.
- That Was a good one.

944
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,851
That was Chef Leon.

945
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:23,228
I Was asking him to garnish my
chicken piccata with French's Mustard.

946
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,494
But he's such a perfectionist,
he said no.

947
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,400
He didn't wanna ruin his masterpiece.

948
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,030
French's Mustard, chicken pickoters...

949
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,768
You're a droWning man, Mayor Gunn.

950
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:37,335
- DroWning man!
- Chef Leon, it's Mayor...

951
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,143
Chef Leon, Larry. Health inspector.

952
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,817
Yeah, I'm up here
with your partner-in-crime,

953
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,649
soon-to-be ex-Mayor Gunn.

954
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:50,419
He is singing like an autistic choirboy
at the American Idol.

955
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,618
Told me the whole story.

956
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,223
Yeah.

957
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,094
Oh, really?

958
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,931
So that French's Mustard
really tastes that good on it?

959
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,666
No kidding. Yeah? No, no.

960
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,174
No, I don't feel like an idiot at all.

961
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:11,235
No, we're... No. Matter of fact,
I'm gonna run and get some.

962
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:16,080
Oh, yeah, we was just talking about how
it tastes and stuff, good and all that.

963
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,278
Yeah, to... I gotta go.

964
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,626
This is hard to sWallow.

965
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:27,123
Don't worry about it, Butlin.
we'll be all right.

966
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,289
No, no, that Was my cool catchphrase.

967
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,425
"It's hard to sWalloW."
SWalloWing is impeded.

968
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,594
Chef Leon, it's Mayor...

969
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,704
- Chef Leon, Larry. Health inspector.
- Cripe's sake.

970
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,069
Nice work, Jane.

971
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,672
This is the guy you Were thinking
about letting in your pants?

972
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,646
Looks like he has trouble
getting into his oWn pants.

973
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,407
Oh, my God!

974
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,248
- Shut up already.
- Mom, enough!

975
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,349
Come here.

976
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:28,253
You accused the Mayor.
You had no evidence.

977
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,184
I had a gut feeling.

978
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,657
Man, it might have been indigestion,
actually.

979
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,196
Well, you've been an embarrassment
to this department a long time,

980
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,665
- but now you're officially a liability.
- That's harsh.

981
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:42,067
I wore the wire. It wasn't his fault.
I thought the Mayor was guilty, too.

982
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,195
This was your first assignment.

983
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,900
You're only guilty
of secondhand stupidity.

984
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,538
MoonPie ?

985
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,947
Can't believe I actually got fired.
That sumbitch.

986
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:59,652
After all I've done for this company,
for them to go ahead...

987
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,016
Hey! What the...

988
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,456
Hey, that's my truck!

989
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,968
NoW it is officially a sucky day.

990
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,538
Whatever it is, it can't be so bad

991
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,510
a plate of chicken and waffles
can't make it go away.

992
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,376
You don't even know.

993
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,974
I even deep-fried the coleslaw
just the way you like it.

994
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:34,480
Man, Shug, I screwed up.
I lost my thing.

995
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,080
Your virginity?

996
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,827
No, I lost that
when I Was horseback riding

997
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:40,623
When I Was 10.

998
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:46,099
No, I lost my nose for the truth.
That's what I did.

999
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,700
You knoW what,
you gonna laugh when I tell you this,

1000
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,400
but I actually thought
at one point in time

1001
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:56,376
that you Was the one behind all the
food poisonings at these restaurants.

1002
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,910
I didn't say you did. I Was just...

1003
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,213
You're gonna laugh about this
in the morning.

1004
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,956
What the hell?

1005
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:43,620
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me,
Mr. Mayor. This is for you.

1006
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:29,838
Hi, Larry.

1007
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,533
Hey, Donnie! Thank the Lord.

1008
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,134
Hey, you wanna play some ball?

1009
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:42,675
You have misrepresented
a deeply-loved public official.

1010
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,221
Dickweed.

1011
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,656
Larry, it's Jane.

1012
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:30,992
Larry?

1013
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,498
Larry, open the door.

1014
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:37,835
What do you Want,
you backstabbing backstabber?

1015
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,237
You're drunk.

1016
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:42,436
Well, I may be drunk,

1017
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,173
but in the morning I'll be sober.

1018
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:49,051
And you'll be
a backstabbing backstabber.

1019
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,382
But tomorrow, I'll still be drunk.

1020
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,214
Hey, why don't you just go run over
to your buddy, the Mayor?

1021
01:04:56,325 --> 01:05:00,091
Larry, open this door, or I'm gonna call
the police and have them break it doWn.

1022
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,426
You ain't the first Woman
to make that threat.

1023
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:06,490
However, you are the first one
to make that threat to get in here.

1024
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,794
Get me the police.

1025
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:11,768
Hello, police?

1026
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,707
Hello? I'm standing outside

1027
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,748
114 Sycamore Street.

1028
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:31,883
Another lie.

1029
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,321
Boy, I tell you what,
lies just fall out of your mouth

1030
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:39,925
like stuff that falls
out of people's mouths when they lie.

1031
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:44,437
Larry, What are you talking about?
I've never lied to you. Never.

1032
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:49,540
You are so busted, Jane.

1033
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,004
If that's even your real name, Jane.

1034
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:57,512
I mean, I seen you canoodling
with the Mayor what's-his-toes.

1035
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,248
Oh, good... Do you even know
What canoodling means?

1036
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:04,725
Yes, I do know. Canoodle. To canoodle.

1037
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,658
- WoW.
- I don't know.

1038
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,093
You are an idiot!

1039
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,423
You knoW what?
I may be, but tomorrow...

1040
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,434
You'll still be an idiot.

1041
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,164
Amy called me.
She told me what happened.

1042
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,263
She didn't believe
the Mayor wasn't involved,

1043
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,968
so she asked me
to go on a date With him

1044
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:24,808
to see if I could get him to do
or say anything incriminating, okay?

1045
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,472
You get it, dumb ass?

1046
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,449
Damn, girl, what got into you?

1047
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,646
Why, you're more fired up
than Rosie O'Donnell at the titty bar.

1048
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,782
I don't know.
Listen, listen, the Mayor gave me this.

1049
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,089
He told me to expect
a hot personal message from him.

1050
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,597
'Course, I gave bigballer23
a fake address.

1051
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,328
- Who?
- Bigballer23.

1052
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,331
That's His Honor's
super-secret address

1053
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:54,500
for his super-secret little affairs
With super-stupid girls.

1054
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,805
Bigballer23.

1055
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,281
Larry!

1056
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,014
Bigballer23.

1057
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,862
NoW we're getting someWhere.

1058
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:19,263
Well, I hope
you got good insurance, man.

1059
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,132
These punks sure did a number
on your truck.

1060
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,569
Are you serious?

1061
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,874
You know how much money
I put into that truck?

1062
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:29,876
Unbelievable.

1063
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:32,937
Are you kidding me?

1064
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:36,448
SWeet! They didn't even touch it.

1065
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,179
Unbelievable.

1066
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,216
Hey, what are the odds of this?

1067
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:45,555
Somebody steal your truck,
and it looks good as new.

1068
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,288
It's unbelievable.

1069
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,259
You know what that is?

1070
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,097
That's a miracle
from the Lord Jesus himself.

1071
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:57,263
I'm gonna start going to church
every Sunday 'cause of this.

1072
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,604
Except for next Sunday,
'cause I got a fishing tournament.

1073
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,176
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

1074
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,745
Oh, I got that kind of face.

1075
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,872
People are always getting me confused
with guys that cheated on their wives

1076
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:09,542
in the Port-O-Let at Daytona Beach
during the Budweiser Shootout

1077
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,313
at about 4:00 in the afternoon...

1078
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,480
No, no, I know where it is.
Micelli's. Yeah, that's it.

1079
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,820
Yeah, my wife and I went there
the other day for dinner.

1080
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:20,919
Yeah, you were there. Couldn't get in.
The Mayor stood up for you.

1081
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,461
- That's cool.
- Yeah, I was up there at Micelli's.

1082
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,535
Let me ask you this, hoW long
did it take you to hit the Mylanta bottle

1083
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,125
after you got sick up there?

1084
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,835
From the food.
After you got sick on the food.

1085
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,272
I didn't get sick.

1086
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:37,368
Yeah. We had friends join us later.
They didn't get sick, either.

1087
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,175
That's interesting.

1088
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,778
Mr. Mayor. Expecting somebody else?

1089
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,878
Larry, this is ridiculous. Look around.

1090
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,854
I got security men all over this park.

1091
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,417
One false move from you,
they'll be handcuffing you to the bench.

1092
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,225
Well, that'd give us something else
in common, wouldn't it,

1093
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,857
bigballer23?

1094
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,766
I don't know what you're talking about.

1095
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:04,669
- Bet your wife would knoW.
- Please, don't upset my Wife.

1096
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,565
Larry, is there anything
I could do for you?

1097
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,073
I could use some free rental
on bowling shoes on Saturday.

1098
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,545
I could do that.

1099
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,116
What does that have to do
with you recommending me

1100
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:17,447
for the fancy restaurant beat?

1101
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:21,455
Yes, someone did recommend you,
but I had nothing to do With it.

1102
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,046
Who did it?

1103
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,990
No, no, careful With the shirt.
It's a Donald Trump.

1104
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,186
Are you kidding me?

1105
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,660
I didn't even know
he had his oWn collection.

1106
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:31,199
Wait a minute. Who did it? Who did it?

1107
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:36,837
Lily Micelli?

1108
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,164
The oWner of the restaurant?

1109
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,743
Yep.
Seems like the Mayor and the Mudcelli

1110
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,005
Were making a little weenie linguini.

1111
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,908
And she asked him to recommend you
for the five-star restaurant beat?

1112
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,509
That's right. Notice When I got the gig,
she stopped dilling his pickle.

1113
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,282
- "Dilling his pickle"?
- Look, I could do this all day.

1114
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:58,451
But why would Lily Micelli
want the Mayor to put Larry on the job?

1115
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,625
- Because she wanted a sucker.
- That's right.

1116
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:06,098
And when she couldn't find one,
she got me.

1117
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:11,404
Well, you Was half-right, Butlin.
Look at that!

1118
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,605
You thought Big Shug was the one
knocking out all the competition.

1119
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,337
Right idea. wrong poisoner.

1120
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:23,011
- I always knew he was innocent.
- No, just wait.

1121
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,246
Larry, when we ate at Micelli's,
we got sick, remember?

1122
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,323
My mom
will still not go near that bathroom,

1123
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:29,584
and she got it re-grouted.

1124
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,161
That reminds me.
Tell your mom I need to go doWn there

1125
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,662
to housewares and pick her up
some new kitty cat dishtowels.

1126
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,698
Larry, we need evidence.

1127
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,462
If I accuse someone else
and I'm wrong again, I might just...

1128
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:45,268
End up like me.
Butlin, you have done a tremendous job.

1129
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:46,966
And I don't need you
risking your neck no more.

1130
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,408
This is my problem.
I'm gonna clean it up.

1131
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:50,478
How?

1132
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,274
You can't go anywhere near Lily
or the All City

1133
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,440
without Tatlock going ballistic.

1134
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,074
we'll see about that.

1135
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:03,156
The prize? $250,000.
But more than just money,

1136
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,456
the All City is the Super Bowl
of cook-offs.

1137
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:10,195
Once there were 10, now there are two.

1138
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,961
A strange, controversial
series of events

1139
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:16,196
has left us with
Big Shug's Tasty Chicken and Waffles

1140
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,035
and Micelli's.

1141
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,476
classic David versus Goliath
showdown.

1142
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:28,146
Judging tonight's event is the reigning
Miss Tri-County, Sung Yoo,

1143
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,578
Channel 13 Food Critic Ted Baily,

1144
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:36,249
and star of Leave It to Beaver,
Jerry Mathers.

1145
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:41,990
And last, but certainly not least,
the finest mayor this city has ever had.

1146
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:43,792
Please, put your hands together

1147
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,925
for the honorable Mayor,
Maurice T. Gunn!

1148
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,663
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1149
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,343
On an undercover,
a feller can live or die

1150
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:01,177
by the credibility of his disguise.

1151
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,712
What do you think, Schmoolie?

1152
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,651
I kneW it. I look too much
like Russell Crowe, don't I?

1153
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:16,230
Ms. Micelli, Mr. Shug,

1154
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,197
you know what your mission is.

1155
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,536
To make a starter fit for a king
in three minutes.

1156
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,600
Are you ready? Let's go!

1157
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:31,604
And we're off. Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all been waiting for.

1158
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:35,741
It's uptown versus downtown,
the boxer versus the puncher,

1159
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,786
high society versus high cholesterol.

1160
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,648
Holy Coke nails, Batman!

1161
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:47,086
Larry, how's it coming in there?

1162
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,828
What do you think?
Think it makes me look fat?

1163
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:53,798
You're under arrest.

1164
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:56,894
You is under arrest for violations
of Code 9.

1165
01:12:58,173 --> 01:12:59,731
Freeze, Mucelli!

1166
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,010
No, you're right. I don't like it.

1167
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:12,179
Micelli, a vision of loveliness.
Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson."

1168
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,679
Gotta tell you,
I'd eat Big Shug's underwear

1169
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:18,317
if he dipped it in batter
and dropped it in some grease.

1170
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,755
I don't know, Schmoolie.

1171
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:25,429
I don't think they're gonna buy into
this ridiculous outfit, either.

1172
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,503
Hey.

1173
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:34,400
Folks, you have to wonder,
how does Micelli stay so poised,

1174
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,604
and where did Shug
find that much lime-green fabric ?

1175
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,249
Be that as it may,
Round 1 has come to an end.

1176
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:45,252
The crowd is on the edge of their seats,
ripe with anticipation.

1177
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:55,319
Five, four, three, two, one.

1178
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,460
What's the over-under on that?

1179
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,995
Okay, I'll take tWo dimes on Houston.

1180
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,125
Okay!

1181
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,568
Golly gee, that's pretty high.

1182
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,166
Folks, you can cut the tension
with a knife.

1183
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,677
Judges, have you reached a decision ?

1184
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,382
The Beave
appears to be phoning this one in.

1185
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,083
Yes, we have.

1186
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:22,651
We award the starter round to
Big Shug's Tasty Chicken and waffles.

1187
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,993
Down goes Micelli.

1188
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:29,257
Big Shug delivers a big upset,
and the crowd loves it.

1189
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:31,457
Look at them.
They can't get enough of this guy.

1190
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,467
Oh, that is a... That is quite a surprise.

1191
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,628
Do you mind
if we get a picture together?

1192
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:36,761
There you have it, folks.

1193
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,340
Big Shug, clearly the underdog,
comes out swinging.

1194
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,539
That's fantastic. That's just fantastic.

1195
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:46,938
You looking at my breasteses?

1196
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,518
Let's have a big hand for Big Shug,

1197
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,647
clearly the dark horse
of this event so far!

1198
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,384
Clearly

1199
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,393
the underdog, the winner!

1200
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,894
Let's go on to the next round...

1201
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:04,056
If we don't win the next round,

1202
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,859
you're all going to be getting
phone calls from the INS tomorroW.

1203
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:13,033
- I Was born here.
- That's what you think.

1204
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,833
Oh, God, I hate the chicken man.

1205
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,903
The chicken man, the chicken man.

1206
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,495
He can't win because he's a joke.
He's here because he's a joke.

1207
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:46,870
That's why he's winning.

1208
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:51,173
Because you got lazy.
You got complacent.

1209
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:55,811
Oh, shut up, uni-brow!

1210
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,986
Now, look, I've gotten rid of the rest
of the competition here.

1211
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:03,319
I can certainly get rid
of Chicken Not-so-little.

1212
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,454
No, no, no. Look,

1213
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,359
we know that whatever they give him
to cook, he's gonna deep-fry.

1214
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:12,923
So what we'll do is We'll just drop
a little emetic in his grease, right?

1215
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:14,468
And it's game over.

1216
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:20,297
Larry.

1217
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,876
Oh, damn.

1218
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:24,711
Larry?

1219
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,372
This is hard to swallow.

1220
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,952
Good catchphrase. No?

1221
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,027
Freeze! Health Department.

1222
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,390
Freeze! Health Department.

1223
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:51,836
- You're going doWn, you piece of crap.
- Not me, I'm a floater!

1224
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,844
Say so long to the toilet.

1225
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,108
Do you know what this is?

1226
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,455
80 cc's of ipecac
in a Bolton-Serta model 25A

1227
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:12,254
- plastic disposable syringe?
- No.

1228
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:15,194
It's the same poison I used
to ruin the reputation

1229
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,198
of every four-star restaurant
in this toWn.

1230
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,596
And now it's gonna go
straight up your ass.

1231
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:35,984
Eat it!

1232
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,086
Eat it!

1233
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,859
It's okay, it's okay. I got you.

1234
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,802
It's okay, it's okay. I got you.

1235
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,932
Okay, all right, happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.

1236
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:11,314
Do you like that, huh?
Take that. Take that one, too!

1237
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,615
Don't mess with Hasidic Larry.

1238
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:15,987
Oh, I think I hurt my nuts.

1239
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,121
Anything you wanna say to me, boss?

1240
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:25,325
- Or should I say confess?
- Confess?

1241
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,829
Are you out of your...

1242
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:30,404
You was in on this thing
all from the beginning.

1243
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:33,406
When I shoWed up there at Micelli's,
you had her give me the squirts.

1244
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:37,444
That ain't very Christian, especially on
a night when I was fixing to get some.

1245
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,673
On a first date? I don't think so.

1246
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:42,017
Yeah, but you never heard me
do my song.

1248
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:46,313
Turns out me and Jane
was the only ones that got sick up there.

1249
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:51,381
And it turns out
they's only one person, uno persono,

1250
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:55,390
that told Jack Dabbs
to send me doWn there to Micelli's,

1251
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:56,828
and that was you.

1252
01:18:57,799 --> 01:18:59,528
That's right. That was you.

1253
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:01,436
Hello?

1254
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,271
Hello?

1255
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,739
Larry. Larry!

1256
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,632
Get... No, get doWn. Larry! Larry!

1257
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:11,312
It was Jack! Jack! He's right there.

1258
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:13,781
Oh, my God.

1259
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:15,516
Oh, God.

1260
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:19,149
It's a miracle! Praise the Lord!

1261
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,812
Larry, he was never really handicapped.

1262
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,948
Butlin, why do you gotta be
such a dadgum atheist?

1263
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:28,428
I mean, here you have a feller
that rosed up out of a wheelchair.

1264
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:34,094
You bring shame on all of us!

1265
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,730
Hey, stop that wannabe cripple!

1266
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:49,613
Just try it, you non-crippled prick.

1267
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,952
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1268
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:04,827
Dickweed.

1269
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,400
Oh, crap.

1270
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:13,133
Attaboy, Donnie!

1271
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,143
Dickweed!

1272
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,884
Well, Butlin,
we knoWed Lily had an ugly sister,

1273
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:29,685
but who'd have thunk she had
an un-crippled nepheW, Jack Dabbs.

1274
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:32,553
The Adam's apple?

1275
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,996
- You hit me in the Adam's apple?
- It hurt, don't it?

1276
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,724
My granddaddy taught me that.

1277
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,291
You caused this department
a lot of embarrassment, Larry.

1278
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,961
But you saved it some, too.

1279
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:46,131
Well, I guess
that makes us about even right there.

1280
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,543
Now we're even.

1281
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:54,510
Does that mean...

1282
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,414
Does that mean that I get my job back?

1283
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:02,883
Well, look, I... We'll act like
the past few weeks never happened.

1284
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,016
One more thing, though. A promotion.

1285
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,991
Don't push your luck, pal.

1286
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,427
Not for me, for the... For the girl.

1287
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:13,699
Hey, man, you told me she Was a he.

1288
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:17,169
Listen, I'm not asking for a raise
or a bigger office or nothing.

1289
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,934
All's I want's a little respect
every now and then.

1290
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,670
And when I say, "every now and then,"
I mean now.

1291
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:31,180
You did a good job today.

1292
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:33,744
Thank you.

1293
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:36,289
Don't you have a gay parade to get to?

1294
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:39,925
I'm just kidding.
I know you ain't a flipper.

1295
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,030
- So what happens next?
- Well,

1296
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:45,724
I figured on Monday
we'd head doWn there

1297
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,234
to Sakamoto's joint
and give him a hard time.

1298
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,769
He loves that.

1299
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,965
Then let's go to the Greek restaurant,
check for eyebrow hair in the...

1300
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,065
- You're back.
...gyros. Oh, hey.

1301
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,075
I don't hug dudes.

1302
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:02,147
- See you on Monday, partner.
- See you Monday, partner.

1303
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:11,886
So what was it that you said
about a song?

1304
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,962
Oh. Yeah, a song.

1305
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,392
If we get into it, there ain't no...
You know, this'll be it.

1306
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,162
I'm gonna sing it,
and you'll be putty in my hands.

1307
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,931
Okay. Come on.

1308
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,107
Oh, man.

1309
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:29,303
All right, that's what you wanna do,

1310
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,902
is singing songs, I guess We'll do it.

1311
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,174
I'm gonna sing it now.

1312
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,616
The song that we've been waiting for.
I'm gonna...

1313
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:53,429
Hello?

1314
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,301
No.

1315
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,732
I'm gonna be down there.
Don't touch nothing.

1316
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,102
Bye.

1317
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:02,373
Trouble at the Golden Goose.

1318
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,707
Oh, but, Larry,
we were having such a good time.

1319
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:09,113
I know, Jane, and I wanna stay.
But let me explain something to you.

1320
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:13,153
This World is full of molds
and creepy-crawlies

1321
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:14,619
and mildews.

1322
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,419
And damn it, Jane,
I'm the health inspector.

1323
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,494
Okay. But when you come back...

1324
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:30,564
Oh, damn. Now, that sounded dirty.

1325
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:33,330
Git-R-Done !

1326
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:39,213
- Who are you talking to?
- All the people out there.

1327
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:41,248
Hi, people. Say, "Git-R-Done!"

1328
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,817
- I don't see any people.
- Just say it, right there.

1329
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,785
Git-R-Done!

1330
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,151
Oh, that turns me on. Git-R-Done!

1331
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,118
Probably because they were afraid
that the sun on these rides

1332
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,818
would be too strong,
and without the proper protection

1333
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,485
I sometimes get these, like,
second-degree burns.

1334
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,029
But you're here,
and you're here to protect me.

1335
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,291
Oh, you knoW what?
Let's go do the other ride.

1336
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,264
with the animals and the balloons,
where you pop the balloons,

1337
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:00,800
and then you get a stuffed animal
of some sort.

1338
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,199
And you can choose, actually,
what animal you want.

1339
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:04,168
You can choose the animal you want.
I don't have to choose it.

1340
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:05,671
I might wanna choose it,
because there's a tiger.

1341
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,969
I've always wanted a tiger in my house.

1342
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:11,642
- who are your girlfriends?
- Lizzie and Tina.

1343
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:15,773
- Larry, can I have one of them?
- Sure. Come on in, Donnie.

1344
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:19,815
- Can I have both of them?
- No. You're retarded.

1345
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:22,355
Dude, you messing With my woman?

1346
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,255
What's up With that?
That Jane, that's my woman.

1347
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,355
- I didn't know that.
- Damn right.

1348
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:30,260
- It's ridiculous.
- Why you didn't tell me?

1349
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:32,731
You ever kiss a white boy?
Come on, kiss me.

1350
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,530
Please don't worry.
It Was definitely not your fault.

1351
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,832
I mean, I Was bound
to get fired from that job. I'm not...

1352
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,839
- Larry, where have you been?
- Not really cut out for...

1353
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:40,965
I've been looking all over for you.

1354
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,475
What the hell?

1355
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,005
Well, douche me with dishwater.

1356
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:48,639
Ain't this a turd in the punch bowl?

1357
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:53,554
He said today that he wrote someone up
for a Richard Gere Offense

1358
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,317
because his back door
wasn't rodent-proofed.

1359
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,891
I do not recall
a Richard Gere Ordinance,

1360
01:24:57,992 --> 01:24:59,789
and I Was first in my class.

1361
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:01,486
Check the archives.

1362
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:04,326
Git-R-Done, Git-R-Done, Git-R-Done,
done, done.

1363
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,115
Say the line, mother... Say the line!

1364
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,748
George, your mom got big boobs?

1365
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,321
She sure does!

1366
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:22,667
Get her done.

1367
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,539
I love it
When a girl says, "Git-R-Done."

1368
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:29,880
The movie's over.
Y'all go and get some Milk Duds.
