A little fine tuning.



The phone rings.



Hey, baby. How are you?



- What is it?
- Hey, baby.



- Is that why I think it is?
- I do not know why you think it --



- But it nevertheless is a fine time.
- I think it is a huge camera.



What happened to a small camera?
With it could liikkuakin.



Are you going to turn off the car,
or staring at me so?



It's big and impressive --



and it is a really bright light.



- Give the camera a kiss.
- I do not give.



I am so close to you.
I kiss you, I am a camera.



Turn it.



Turn it.
What are you doing?



Guessed.



- Do you think this a success?
- I think it is interesting --



save something supernatural phenomenon,
occurs on or not.



Really, how much did you pay for it?



About half of what I deserved today.



- Thank you. Eat?
- Climb the stairs only.



Good God.



- I am here.
- Good.



Here we are.



- Strange.
- We are weird.



- Rather than strange.
- We see some upward.



You do not look straight at the camera.



- There 's way.
- Exactly. Looking good.



Describe only what we
now, will happen.



If something strange happens --



we can save it for posterity.



Thus, we can always
remember the heat?



Hopefully we can camera
to understand what is at stake.



When we understand what is at stake,
we can act as required by the situation.



- Good thing.
- We take care of properly, which then are talking about it.



If it is a neighbor's child,
who has a crush on you --



and try to kurkkia
the window at night, so...



- Go get them. - If it does not have a child
followed me until the age of eight, --



- I do not think this is about.
- Truly creepy.



You said it.
I understand that you are...



Are you okay?
How are you feeling?



- Are you talking to you...
- Are you happy? Battery is enough?



You should be loved
I am not a machine.



- We will be sleeping with this camera.
- What?



- It will be the bedroom.
- Full yצksikצ? - I do not know.

- Yes.



Ujostuttaa. Do away.



You are quite red.



Since only.



- Sound Test.
- Is this the last test?



Yes. Can you talk about?



Hey, Micah. You are the world
the best boyfriend, --



except for odd
affection for electronics.



- Katie, say something.
- What do you want me to say?



Something very quietly.



- What do you want me to say?
- Whisper.



- I Whisper. Can you hear me?
- Whisper.



- I kuiskaan.
- No, you will whisper.



- Kuiskaan now.
- It was a whisper. Would be saved.



None other than the will to make money.



Everything is in working order, baby.



Great.



Do you know any tricks, --



- By which they may be stories about the event?
- I do not want to --



them, or... I do not want
it happen at all.



I do not want to force it to happen.



Fine, if you save
something, but I am not going to...



I say only --



because the camera is good
be a number of reasons.



- Would claim in a confirmation...
- I know. Please do not believe me?



Of course.



What is that?



Let's examine the matter.
I hear a strange sound.



Can you hear it?



Fridge is it?



It is an ice machine.



Damn!



Ghosts come out only when we sleep.



I want to present this
player great beauty.



I meant to him.
This is just a guitar.



You're cute.



- What is it?
- I like just your feet. They are sexy.



- Toe nails should stop.
- Exactly.



Hot pack. May I
strippausta a little?



- Et.
- Please. Only half.

- No.



Okay. I will do just what you want.



- No.
- Oh, damn.



I get a dance later.
He does not just hold the camera.



- Back to Venus' position.
- I do not.



- Where will you get it?
- I do not know. Where did it should get?



The bathroom or corridor.



In the corridor we heard the steps.



Here is a dark time.



- Can not you see here?
- I am not at all.



What if the kindle?



- It is a good one.
- Do we need more light?



- No, that I think is enough.
- Okay.



Come and see.



What was the rule "no cameras here?"



- Kamerahan point is already old?
- We could...



- Do not worry if it got wet.
- A little time outside of school stuff.



We could do it, but did not.



- A good company though.
- You do not know that I cry inside.



- Crying out only. I know that was a fascinating.
- You are totally uninteresting.



I take the camera back.



This is connected via FireWire.
Leave it to the camera.



- Operates as a guess.
- Works or not?



I guess it work.



Creator.



- I thought this is a nice peak.
- Come on, this will be a lot of fun.



1. NIGHT
SEPTEMBER 18 DAY, 2006



It looks to me.



In that Katie appears in the morning.



She is so beautiful.



Exactly.



Micah describes a debate now.



I'm not going to pass him.



Micah follow me with the camera.
He is a little irritating, --



- But I like him a lot of time yet.
- You are a wonderful, when siristelet.



It would be a 3.0 lהiskהhdysasteikolla.



What's even doing there?



- I describe to you.
- Really?



Really mature.



- Therefore, I guess...
- I got a good whopper!



Traits that I think I
it should most often. Maturity.



And political correctness.



I've from Crawford Texas.



- Is there something wrong with Texas?
- George W. Bush in my home.



Texas is the only state,
where you can buy --



singon for self-defense.



That is why I support the arms.



Especially for children and small dogs.



Great day. Meedio will come here.
He should arrive within the hour.



Looking for Micah and it is considered
what he thinks.



He is very excited.
Probably. Hey, baby.



Tell us how excited you are --



to meet the psychic,
who arrives within the hour.



Doctor arrives soon. Great.



- I am really excited.
- Show enthusiasm ilmeesi.



Will you be able to contain yourself?
Get all out. Do not be shy.



- Do not be shy. What are you doing?
- I work with.



I found something --



- Suitable mediums, I guess.
- What?



- I ran into it.
- Show it.



I'll call this when he arrives.
He feels at home.



You do not take any of this seriously.



I would like her is feeling
home. Welcome.



- This way.
- This does not arise in his home.



This leads him --



to leave. You are here
violated, not me.



And do not smile in the so -
pleased with yourself.



Would less music?



- Great.
- Will he make me investment tips?



I'm not investing in horses and now.



- Maybe he has a great tip.
- I got enough of you.



Do you think this psychic
incoming time?



Would he predict the
traffic congestion?



Genius.



- Wait, I take it the music.
- Do not even think about it.



- Dr. Fredrichs? Good day.
- Nice to meet you.



Take another Step inside. Here is the
Micah. I regret the camera.



Do you see things in advance?
Although traffic congestion?



Usually it depends on the
weeks from the date or time.



- As with all of this.
- I will always be summoned to do so in San Diego.



I am always ready to do so.



I am really glad that you got
today. I appreciate it a lot.



I would like to learn a little familiar to you.
To get a little more information --



than letting the phone.
Both of you.



What is your life?
What is your relationship?



- It is a good one.
- Well, it's a wonderful thing.



- How long have you dating?
- Three years.



We have agreed to menevהmme
engaged, as long as he is ready.



- What about jobs?
- I am a student.



Majoring in the mother tongue, and a minor in Spanish.
I hope graduating soon as a teacher.



I still do not know the place.



Micah is the date the investor.



What about health?



Both health is good.



- Does any medications?
- No.



Quite often to tell
such things as --



can be explained simply.



As creaky houses
kolisevilla or water pipes.



In a normal event.



People just more frightened,
because they are very stressed.



So this --



has been haunting you
even before the change here?



Yes. It began, --



when I was eight years old.



Residence time, of course,
their parents.



I divided my room five years of age
Christie with my sister.



At that time, we both experienced a...



What now then it was.
I felt the breath-inspiring me.



Woke my sister. This...



It could be called
varjomaiseksi mass.



Figure. Pההdyssה my bed.



It was always my pההdyssה my bed.
Not my sister. However, he saw it.



- He, too, therefore, saw it?
- Guaranteed. We had both --



absolutely horrified.



We could not even move.



It was horrible.



We prayed that it would stop.
So eventually did.



It continued for some time
first in the house.



We... Was on fire. All came out.
Fortunately, no one is hurt.



However, we lost everything.



- So we moved.
- Was the fire to be out?



No.



I'm not saying that it relates to --



kummittelujuttuun. I do not at all.
I do not know what it was.



Tutkiko Fire Department fire outbreaks?



I do not know, were made in the criminal investigation.
Outbreaks of trying to find out yes.



And not been revealed.
It was not an Electrical.



- No, nothing so simple.
- Are you, therefore, until the age of eight --



- Experienced in this seasonally over the years?
- Yes.



It has been seasonally
13-years old.



The last couple of weeks
things are starting to happen again.



When you say that it moved
childhood home --



a place where asuit
At age 13, and now here, --



appear that we are dealing with
associated with one of you.



These lights are vהlkkyneet.
These roof lights.



Water taps are wide open and
inexplicably closed.



We come down we put them stick
to come back and they are open.



Currency at a lot of wasted water.
Without both of these reasons.



We have heard paukutusta
from the walls. Scratch sounds.



Than along the wall
raavittaisiin down.



- It is a long tone?
- Yes.



- Most of it is taking place here?
- Yes.



I have heard a whisper.
Sometimes I do not understand it.



Sometimes it says my name.



- It therefore invites you your name?
- It has already happened.



- Have you heard of this, Micah?
- I have heard strange noises.



I have not heard anyone
calling Katie. Except myself.



- It could be me in my dreams.
- Yes I can see the difference, --



when you say my name in bed, --



and from the whispers here
it directly to the ear.



So goes the action looming over FireWire.



We can save the entire night.
I would take this?



Stand and wide-angle lenses can be found.
We can describe the whole room.



EVP recorder. Votes against.



Therefore kindle a light and
picture of you to sleep?



- Do you do this every time?
- Filming began only recently.



There is another bathroom.
There are guest rooms.



- Lights flicker here.
- So you have not seen --



- The hazy shape...
- It happens only in the bedroom.



Can we do something to get
these things happen?



- That we could describe them.
- I told him that I do not want it.



- I do not want to even have a camera.
- Haunting intensifies the negative energy.



If, therefore, takes place here
something negative, --



it helps to spread haunting.



Strong feelings can feed it.



We could deny your mother
from entering the village.



- Quit screwing around.
- Through the ages --



religious movements have
was good and the evil creatures.



Christians have the angels and demons.



Angels are good and
Of course, evil demons.



Religion of these
cases have occurred throughout history.



Despite the fact whether a believer or not.
So it is trying to reach you.



I do not want you to answer it.
You can not escape from it.



You can not escape from here and
expect it to remain here.



If you leave here, it
you follow behind you.



The matter must be resolved here.



Areas of Expertise is
with the ghosts of action.



I have built my career to it.
I will help connect people received --



of blind people and
to communicate with ghosts.



People's lives with the dead.



A daemon is a different matter.
It is a being --



is associated with a non-human.



What could it be,
Opposition debated and discussed a lot.



It is not the man.



Demons are not my field.
I do not like it at all.



I also say honestly sensing,
that something is going on here.



I heard what you said, but the upstairs
the bedroom had strong feelings.



This creature, whatever it may be,
not like the fact that I'm here.



You can not escape this, or it will follow you.



It may be inactive for years.



One can not get it
while active.



Over time, it tries to
communicate with you.



I will give you a doctorate
John Abrams name.



He is a colleague and Demonology.
He specializes in such.



- He lives in Los Angeles.
- Listen to this.



Why do not we just find out what
it wants and give it to them?



- Then it is removed.
- Because it would probably Katie.



If you are trying to play it
with the Ouija-board, --



creature can sense that you are trying to
communicate with it.



It opens the door and invite it inside.



History of the known cases of
such objects damaged people.



Not many, but this is
occurred. In some cases, --



although very rare,
people have been killed.



I do not tell me this sense of intimidation.
I tell this to give direct information.



- You must know this. Do you understand?
- I understand.



I hope so. You do not happen.



That is nice to hear.
Thank you very much for coming.



Definitely I'll call Dr. Abrams.



- As soon as tomorrow.
- Okay.



Thank you so much, when you take the trouble spot.



- Not doing anything for you.
- Drive safely in properly.



- Time, yes. Good-bye, to both.
- To go back to!



- What hinuri.
- I would try to be kinder?



Data appeared good.
I do not feel crazy.



At least we do something.
I'll call it the type tomorrow.



- What type?
- Dr. John Abrams.



- Do not laugh at me.
- Yes really. Do not call it donated.



- It's crazy.
- I'm going to call her tomorrow.



Do not call.
Promise not to call him.



Enduring one type,
but not large numbers of ghost jengilהisiה.



- If the situation gets worse, I'll call him.
- Okay. If the situation gets worse.



Maybe this is not getting worse.



Sounds better
brushing your teeth.



- A little hobbies outside of school?
- We're shooting with the camera.



- Turn it off for ten minutes.
- Really?



That is all I need.
I do not know about you.



- Turn it off.
- Katie is the bathroom.



- Turn it off.
- Okay.



- I'm trying to do a wee! Turn it off.
- Dr Johan. I am Dr Johan.



- Get the rest from there.
- I Demonology.



- I am talking about, so you can not hear pissaamistani.
- I came to bail you demoneilta.



3. NIGHT
SEPTEMBER 20 DAY, 2006



- What time did you make wake-up call?
- A little more than six.



Good morning.



Did you sleep well?



Okay.



- What do you do?
- I watch last night's tape.



See, this is about 02:10 in the morning.



Doors... Do you see it?



Every house had a door and window
closed. I checked it just now.



The flowers do not move.
But something else is moving.



- The door is moving. It goes even further.
- Good God!



Look at this. It moves again.



- Micah, that's so...
- It is impossible.



- How terrible.
- Exactly.



- Great. I told you that this is worth it.
- I guess you...



- I guess you get something.
- I think I?



Boden was like...



It is precisely to that particular search.



- We would never have known that.
- ִllistysilme.



- It was wonderful.
- The spine.



- If you can get back to a ghost?
- What?



If you can get it to return?
Herהttהisit its interest.



It does not interest me.
I want to just go away.



"Es maestro...



Yu quiero estar una Maestra. "
I want to be a teacher.



Way to go, baby.



Micah! Good God...



Come on! What are you doing?



Come here soon!



- What?
- It's over there! Go get it.



Get rid of that, please.
Do something to it.



Huusitko about why a spider?



Jesus.



- Did you search for first camera?
- Yes.



I thought that here would be haunted.



I am here to horror,
and you seek the camera.



Hey, little friend.



- What is your name?
- Did you described it?



- I have to leave.
- Up, out and jog.



- Straight out. Take it straight out.
- Okay.



- Hey, buddy. It does not want to leave.
- It has to.



You are the... Just straight out.



- Going there.
- Throw it out.



I throw.



Are you here?



Tell us what this was intended.



Was moving the door
part of the grand plan?



Or are you making only random stuff?



No?



We have two options.
It may be a ghost, --



- Or it may be a demon.
- Dr. Fredrichs said, --



- That it is not haunted.
- I studied the evidence.



I studied this and find out what it is.



Whatever it is, it
follow me. It does not seem to...



It does not seem human.
It seems the monster.



- As they want to hurt me.
- It sounds like from a demon.



- That's what he said.
- Are the ghosts of people's lives.



It is certainly not a man.



Maybe you're right, what is bad
thing. Because the demons are deep.



In principle, they are evil spirits, --



that only exist
to cause pain --



and to do evil
acts of personal entertainment.



They may lie in wait for people
for many years. Ten.



Sometimes, they are intimidating
very הlykkההllהkin way.



So we were able to save
extremely rare phenomenon.



Surprisingly, I am not so
enthusiastic than you, --



it minuahan this intimidation.



All is well.
Yes we take care of properly.



I understand that this is new to you.



Somehow exciting.



So I understand the description of your case.



But it is not new to me.



I think that this may
be very dangerous.



I just want you
to know that if the situation...



If the situation progresses or
no worse, --



I want to stop recording.
I do not want to antagonize it.



I can understand.
I just want to remind you --



you little
warned against such a --



- Before we moved together.
- I know.



So perhaps I too
the right to decide matters.



I can understand, but what I would have
could not say perfect first date?



- "I think Demonoid prowl for me"?
- No, but maybe 15 treffeillהmme --



or 30 treffeillהmme or
when we decided to live together --



you could have taken up the matter.



The windows and doors are locked.
The alarm is on.



We know if one comes inside.



I do not think its intermediate
from the alarm and locked the doors.



It can go anywhere
and wants to do what he wants.



- How do you know?
- What will happen --



it is already here.



Okay.



5. NIGHT
SEPTEMBER 22 DAY, 2006



Jesus Christ!



What's happening?



Accordingly, only a bad dream.



Excuse me, when I scared you.



It does not matter. Do not worry about it.



- Are you okay? Are you sure?
- I am. Yes.



Did you hear that?



- I go downstairs.
- Do, Micah!



Micah, do not leave me here.



- Take your camera.
- Please stay here.



What do you think it belonged to?



Wait. Micah, wait!



Is anyone here?



- Oh, my God.
- What?



- You can improve?
- Stop.



Come to bed.



Come here.



Are you okay, honey?



- Yes I am.
- You sure?



I'm still scared.



I am happy that it is morning.



I'm going to watch tape.
I believe they will survive anything.



- Okay.
- Hey, girls.



- If you could just show me...
- Hello! Excuse me.



I know it is time for hobby,
but I do have something to show.



Is not it to wait?
We celebrate important girl time, --



- Micah cameras and not be interrupted.
- Thank you.



- Wait a little.
- Damn, I try to show you something!



- Olehan nicely.
- One thing only.



- Do you want to nose ring?
- The Lord's sake...



Now let's go then.



Here is the tape --



Digital bedroom.



This record is about ten
seconds before awakening.



- What the hell was that?
- I listened to it --



50 times. It does not say anything. It does not
not familiar with any language, and not a dog.



It is not a sound from the street.



It has nothing to feel
electronic interference.



- I think...
- It's the story bedroom.



That creature wants to communicate.



- I thought, therefore, buy a Ouija-board...
- No!



I do not want to know what it says.
I want to leave us alone.



- A bad idea.
- Meedio denied provoking...



- Are you going to call it, therefore, Ouija-board here?
- Excuse me, when I told it.



- It does not get out.
- I do not want to call anything.



- Let me just carry juttuni.
- A bad idea.



The camera is your thing. If you're looking
Ouija-board, it is the end.



Promise me.
Please, Micah.



- I promise that I buy a Ouija-board.
- Thank you.



Love you.



- Unless he buys Ouija-board.
- It can not end it. Smile.



Smile.



- Ah, there he is!
- Come on.



Honey, Is that --



400. playback?



Stop it!



Excuse me. Going very well.



- Get that camera away!
- Do not want to document everything?



- I do not.
- I am photographer. I would like your comments.



I do not do this anymore.



Manage to destroy the rehearsal.
Hell!



We have not received anything
interesting for a while.



- Micah?
- Scared?



- Reply!
- Put the camera away. To go back to bed.



Back to bed.



- Do not irritate it.
- Do you find anything?



- I invite you!
- Enough is enough!



Micah, come on now.



You void a demon!
You is not no good!



- Nothing!
- Put the camera away.



13. NIGHT
SEPTEMBER 30 DAY, 2006



What now?



I thought I just heard something.



What did you hear?



Tצmהhdyksen only.



Tצmהhdyksenkצ? What?



Perhaps the lower floor.



Hell!



Where are you going?
Good God.



Wait!



Micah! Wait.



- Please, we need to go.
- I'm here, baby. All well.



I'm here.



Good God, after all.



It certainly is...



Good God.



Can you hear anything?



- Are you okay, honey?
- I am.



It's gone now, whatever it was.



We have video proof of voting, --



which is the supernatural.



What?



You hear that?



Wait a minute.



- Do you hear that?
- I hear. What is it?



I tremble.



Everyone certainly vapisisi.



This is really good stuff, Katie.



This is... I hope that this guy...
Or whatever it may be, then --



show us more.



- This is crazy stuff.
- We should not do this.



Pelottaakin it here,
when you do not take this seriously.



- I'll take it seriously. I think it is...
- Shoot me to the toilet.



- You look beautiful in the morning otherwise.
- Maybe we should not have a camera.



Hello? This is really hard stuff.



There is no question at this stage,
when great things happen.



- Great? Do not you be afraid?
- Shocking.



After all, it is bizarre.



After all, we only documented the
it. All is well.



Sounded as if it had been
wall or ceiling of the falling tone.



- Or the floor.
- Lattiastako?



- You think?
- I do not know. What then was.



Creator. Like someone had dropped the
something really big and heavy.



Like what? As someone
would have brought the sofa into the air?



Maybe. Very little is made --



before the camera.



- Before what?
- Before the camera.



- This is getting worse all the time.
- The camera does not relate to this.



It was not as bad or noisy.



Does your child afraid of the internal?



I can very well, thank you just.



- I wonder what else it has in mind?
- Do not say that.



- What else yet...
- Do not begging for problems.



Okay.



The first EVP Exam.



Is anybody here?



Where did you come?



Do you have anything to say,
understandably, this time?



Prefer talking to
Ouija-board through?



What is your quest?
What is your favorite color?



Where did you come?



Do you have anything to say,
understandably, this time?



Does not have anything to say?



Prefer talking to
Ouija-board through?



What the hell?



Muriset Is that you?



Does one single
"yes" and two "no"?



Is that what you mean?



Really?



Great.

I do not want to go inside.

You went downstairs and sat keinuun.
I left for you to apply for coverage, --



- Because we refused from entering the inside...
- Rewind to when I go to the stairs.



Indeed, I am leaving the room.



You went out and sat keinuun.



I went inside to get to you
coverage, because we refused to leave.



You were in a strange, katatonisessa mode.



Wait. Puhuinko to you?



I would not call it advocacy.



I came upstairs and I heard steps in the --



and the television was turned on.
It is stored --



bedroom --



when I was downstairs,
and you were outside.



When I came to investigate the matter,
I could not find anything.



It will continue for that.



Maybe this has happened --



for a long time, but you just did not know about it.



I do not remember anything.
I know that I have seen --



- Nightmares all night, and that...
- What?



I do not want to talk about it.
Leave well alone.



- It just tries to scare us...
- It works! I'm afraid.



Just need to stay strong.



I do not let it get to you, and I do not us.



According to the introduction of another, --



exorcist or someone similar,
it is often only make things worse.



- You do not want it?
- I do not.



Me neither.



Just so, a little cunt.



Has something to say?
This is your chance.



- Katie, where are you?
- I am ready soon.



What a shame to leave here
out with my boyfriend...



We have about ten minutes.



- What the hell are you doing?
- Come and help me.



- What are you doing?
- Excise Ouija-board. I told...



You promised me you will not...
Do not look at me like that!



- You promised not to play with it on the board.
- No.



- I promised that I would buy Ouija-board.
- Fuck you!



- You knew what I meant!
- Quoted a Ouija-board...



You knew what I meant! Forbade
playing with it on the board. And what do you do?



You are searching for the best ever seen Ouija-board
and store it in the middle of living rooms.



- Explain it to me!
- I borrowed it.



Exactly the same. You throw it away.
We leave immediately.



No longer the camera or anything.
I do not even want to hear about it.



Do not try. I'm leaving.
Do you come with me?



- Calm down, dear!
- I do not want to hear!



Take off your shoes and go to bed!



Okay.



What did you do?
What did you, Micah? Look at me!



- What did you do?
- I do absolutely nothing.



You are incredible, Micah.



Enough is enough. No more camera.
Not Ouija-board. Nothing.



- Let me handle this. You do not do anything.
- If something happens --



- Stop!
- We must have evidence.



I do not want the bedroom
or the whole house.



It looks as if --



someone should be drawn to something.



I do not know.



- Hey, Katie?
- What?



- Would you help me with this?
- What?



I think that it is being left
Ouija us a message-board.



I do not fucking care about any comparison,
being what it says on the board.



Gold?



Katie?



Fuck off!



- I do not want to look at it.
- Calm down!



- This is the wrong time for this.
- Out!



Get out!



He seems to be angry.



It is a bad thing...



Hi, Katie.



Welcome. I know that
you are angry, but...



Lemon juice is in the final.



What should I do?



- Just tell me what to do.
- Turn off the damn camera will bring.



So the camera is forgotten.



I swear to comply with Katie
The rules and regulations --



camera usage.



And other issues
context. Or something.



- Is my will to you?
- It could be in good faith.



I swear to comply with Katie
The rules and regulations --



relation to the camera,
violation of this creature and I do not --



or whatever it may be, in any
ways. Character or form.



- I swear this.
- "And I promise that I betrayed my confidence in Katie."



I promise that I let you down Katie
confidence. Still more?



That's all.



Good. Hell.



Good night.



Hyvהnyצnsuukon May I?



May I?



Good night.



Katie, you want to --



know what the Ouija-board happened?



I looked at the point.



Does it not be forgotten?



One starts to get some sleep.



I know that you are angry,
but what is done is done, --



and I would like you to help
this settlement.



So sit down.



Or standing. The camera recorded everything,
what happened after leaving the board.



- The pointer was moving by itself.
- Okay.



I'm trying to figure out what it said.



I have found out the exact message,
but the options are many.



I will list them for you.



Do you know anyone whose name is --



Dina or Diane?



There may be no Nadinekin
the second 'N' letter. Do not you?



- I do not.
- I wonder still.



It could just mess around
with us, and does not mean anything.



Or I could be wrong
so many things.



I do not care what it means.



You got to play it.
I want it out of here.



- Whatever.
- No "how to just". I want it off, --



- As promised.
- It is not even mine.



- Get rid of it. Exactly.
- Today.



Do you remember the evening,
when something happened?



- It 's crazy.
- I can not...



- What are you chatting?
- Of all things.



Talostanne strange. Why do not you source?



- I wish it would correct everything.
- Why do not you come with me?



Amber, this is not a house.
This is about me.



It follows me everywhere.
Sotkisimme only business.



I have a plan.
Do not worry.



Micah, what is your plan?



- I have a plan.
- What are you going to do?



- No, he do not know...
- You can be calm, only.



- So?
- This is a compromise.



- What?
- For talkkisi. You do a little experiment.



If it does not work, or help us, --



I play Demonology,
and he will handle this.



- Okay.
- Looked to me, and you camera?



Fits. Excuse me.



- Okay?
- Okay.



Prepare.



- Is the camera turned on?
- It is.



What does this prove about?



If one walks here, it
Time to leave clear footprints.



Yes we seem to already know
that something is happening here.



I'll call him tomorrow.



- You can clean talkkisi tomorrow.
- Take a deep breath, --

what we are dealing with.

- The number of Him to us? Let me handle this.



This is my house,
and you're my woman.



Handle this problem.



- Okay.

A bit of faith.



It is then this.



- What?
- Talc is the last thing.

You are too cute to speak.



Did you hear that?



- Oh, shit.
- Good god.



Good god.



Guess what?



Footprints will be

Good God!



- Do not leave me here.
- Turn on the lights.



This does not seem right.



True talk.



I'm looking for where they came from.



What now? What?



The tracks run out of this.



It can be a trap!
Let's go.



Good God!



You opened that?



- Did you make that? Say that you opened that.
- Of course not.



What the hell is that?



Something is there.



- I go looking into the matter.
- No, you do.



You go over there, Micah.



You go over there.



It needs to be studied.
I am looking for a ladder.



- All Done.
- I do not want you to go over there.



Please.



Micah...



You do not know any of what there is.



Give me the camera.



Be careful.



Do you see anything?



If something goes wrong, I throw
the camera for you and jump down.

What the hell is that?



- There is something about it.
- Come on down.



Micah, please.



- Wait a minute. Here.
- What?

Need to explore what there is.



Oh, my God. Be careful then.



Are you all right?



Answer me!



Thank God.

No. No, no, no...



Nהytהhהn.

- This is an old house.



- What the hell is this doing in the attic?
- What image does not come back?



It is not possible that the
that you found in the attic!



It is not possible that the
is that even exists!



I have not seen the image to that in 15 years.



Just crazy.
Utterly absurd.



We retained any photos?
The first house.



So we lost everything?



I know, but did say,
pictures of the mother's money, --



or whether they are in the car?
In particular, the image --



which you took the time for Easter?



Okay. No, all is well.



Excuse me, when the initiator, the father.



Are you okay, honey?



Turn off the lights, please.



Excuse me.



Where did you did you find it?



Up there it was.

I'm just full of it.



We need both

I need a new life.
I am so tired of this.

I added a light to last night's material.



Steps can be seen.



There.

- What?



What are you going to do?



- I do not know yet.
- I know. We will call Dr. Abrams.



You got your camera, Ouija-lautasi
talkkisi and floor --



and the situation has only worsened. This
should have been done two weeks ago.



We will call him. Today.



There is talk about this first.



- I manage my situation. I've made progress here.
- You 're not.



And you do not control the situation.
It is dominated by the situation.



If you think you mastered
situation, you're an idiot.



None of your case has not helped!



I regret, is not intended to
crush the fantasy, --



but the camera did not help,
nor stupid footprints.



Do you think that it is not being
traces left on purpose?



It wanted to do it!
It wanted to find my photos.



It could be anywhere.
It hears even these words.



- Where the hell do you know?
- You are totally impotent!



- That is not true, and you know it.
- Try to adjust!



I called Dr. Abrams, --



and he is elsewhere.



In a case. I could not have
do otherwise, --



so I called Dr. Fredrichsin back.
You do not like him, but I like.



He will come tomorrow.
It does not get past him.



- So if we get out of it until...
- We can manage fine.



- I know!
- "If we get out." Creator...



Just wait, yes we will come through.

- Types of Hell.



What a joke.

You will have to sleep in between.



I'm scared.



I can not be longer in the bedroom.



I understand.



I can not even be in this house.



I can not even be in the house.



I've missed too much after their studies.



My teacher took me to the office.



He told me I did not pass the course, --



alternately surprised intermediate exam
and cope with it honorably.

Why do not you?

Time has gone badly.



I like the break.



You have told it.

- Excuse me.



- Nervous about it.
- I'm nervous.



Dr Fredrichs, please come inside.

We called Dr. Abrams,
but it is elsewhere.



Yes, he is abroad.
He returns...



- We need your help.
- This is intense.



- The situation is getting worse.
- It is not my presence, --



- I can not help you. I have to leave.
- What?



- My presence irritates the creature.
- You can not just leave.



- Calm down.
- What do we do? Should we leave?



Departure does not help. I will see what
I can do, but I have to leave.



- This is not a joke.
- I will help you, but I can not do it now.



Are you serious?



- Micah, what do we do?
- We take care of this themselves.



For that type of shit. Katie?



Hell.



Do not worry.

I knew that something happened last night.



- Something was in the bedroom.
- You're right.



Oh, shit.



It intends to do something.



I'm looking for online --



people who could help us.



I found this site.
There is a woman, Diane, --



a Ouija-board opportunities.



Happened to him in the 60s
all the same things as you.



- What do you mean?
- All. He was eight years old.



His house burned down.
He saw the shadows or something.



Only God knows.



He called the place of exorcist.



Is he there? You mean
that the 60s was a girl --



- Which was exactly the same things?
- Exactly.



Maybe it is the same thing.



It only took you.
It is all the same.

Ouija-board us --



or trying to tell us to look

What happened to her?
Is he okay?



She is Diane.



- She is beautiful.
- So is there.



One priest, participated in Manaus
smuggled the footage of this --



30 years after the event,
because he wanted to before his death --



all to know that
manaus always succeed.



Before the arrival of The Exorcist --



- Diane was different.
- That he is not.



He only heard the voices
and saw nightmares.



- Oh, my goodness. Look at him.
- I have seen that. Watch Now.



Now he is just... Watch...



They tried to get
rid of it, and sometimes --



it just gets angry about more.



- The situation turned into hell, evil.
- Oh, my God.



God!



He bit the cross.
It's hand.



Everything went very...
He bled to death.



I think it warn us,
we do not fucks with it.



I'm not sure what to do.
Certainly not that.



I do not want to take that risk.



I want this to end.
I do not want this to end --



about.



I tried to find some reason --



Why choose this creature
After you Dianen.



I could not find anything.



I read here that these things
are random.



No reason is not.



I go pitkהlleni.

we can do. New things.



Take the camera off?
I'm trying to learn.



Okay. But I would like to talk about this.

I will try to help in this matter.
I want to talk about my thoughts.



You and your stupid camera you have a problem!
