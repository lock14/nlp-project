2
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,296
Cloud sailers. New toy cloud sailers.

3
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,508
Sora. Tumi.

4
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,807
Welcome.

5
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,438
Roven, Tumi's still sick.

6
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,244
Let's have a look.

7
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,858
- Present. - Kima?

8
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,093
Present.

9
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,534
- Tulo? - Present.

10
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:49,971
- Tumi? - Present.

11
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,302
Senn?

12
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,204
Senn?

13
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,746
Mala?

14
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,180
Mala?

15
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,618
Come on, Senn!

16
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,621
It's only a race if you keep up.

17
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,523
Is it my fault you keep cheating?

18
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:14,859
I don't cheat.

19
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,071
Not all the time.

20
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,169
Classic Mala.

21
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,304
Great. All right.

22
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,643
Very funny. Where are you?

23
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,343
Bye!

24
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,916
That was really funny. You got me... again.

25
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,725
Do you hear that? Is it me?

26
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:50,494
I think it's coming from right below... us!

27
00:05:57,374 --> 00:06:00,241
See? She doesn't think much of your flying, either.

28
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:10,119
Beautiful.

29
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,110
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

30
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:45,121
Turn around and go home?

31
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,103
Hey, Mala? Mala? Probably not a...

32
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,637
Wind tunnel!

33
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,940
Mala, pull up!

34
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,306
Senn, throw the anchor!

35
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:08,935
Mala!

36
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,849
Come on! Come on!

37
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,704
Are you thinking what I'm thinking now?

38
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:47,250
'Cause clearly it's time to go back.

39
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:52,717
Mala, where are you going?

40
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,451
Are you crazy?

41
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:57,585
Mala, you know this place is forbidden.

42
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:01,764
Wasn't the wind tunnel enough?

43
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:04,426
And the huge, crazy sky whale?

44
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,801
Finally, you've come to your senses.

45
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,775
Let's go back now, okay?

46
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:15,573
Senn?

47
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,409
What is that?

48
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,284
Mom, what's that?

49
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,217
Tumi, come inside.

50
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,005
A new god!

51
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,545
A new god in the sky.

52
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:32,812
Go home. The elders will check on you.

53
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,964
Keep moving.

54
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,556
Move along.

55
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,896
All is well.

56
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,562
It has begun.

57
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,835
Is everyone safe here?

58
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,674
Is there anything that you need?

59
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,659
So, you think it's a god?

60
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,494
It could be one of those large rocks.

61
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,431
The kind that fall from the sky from time to time.

62
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,935
It will be whatever the elders tell us it is.

63
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:55,869
I bet I could see what it is.

64
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:58,169
I bet I could make something to help me look closer.

65
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,709
Mala, you know that's forbidden.

66
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,836
But why? It wouldn't hurt anybody.

67
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,438
Inventions that are not approved by the elders

68
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,005
are against our teachings.

69
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,517
Then maybe our teachings are wrong.

70
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,112
Mala! Go to your room.

71
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,918
Right now.

72
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:57,696
Getting closer.

73
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,931
What is that?

74
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:14,470
No.

75
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,212
Sound the alarm!

76
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,989
Everyone, take cover!

77
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,662
Mala?

78
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,290
Everyone, get to your homes.

79
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,628
What is that?

80
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:41,604
Mala! Where are you?

81
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:43,104
Mala!

82
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,780
It's a miracle! They are gods!

83
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:01,520
- Yes. Take me. - No, wait!

84
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,924
Mala!

85
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,156
- Over here! - You see that?

86
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,492
- Where are you? - I'm ready!

87
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:11,193
Tumi! Tumi, where are you?

88
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,998
- I am ready! - I knew this day would come.

89
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,469
- Take me! - Over here!

90
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:16,972
- Over here! - Over here!

91
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,530
Mommy? Mommy?

92
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,200
Mom, where are you?

93
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:24,438
- Oh, no! - Take me!

94
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:28,075
- Everyone please! - Where's my daughter?

95
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,277
Mala?

96
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:30,876
Father.

97
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,752
I'm coming! Father, look out!

98
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,089
No! Please!

99
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:39,788
Let him go! Take me!

100
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:42,832
It's my fault! Please!

101
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,625
Take me! Over here.

102
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:47,692
Please.

103
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:52,969
Fine.

104
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:54,533
I'll do it my way.

105
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:00,573
Come on, take me. Take me.

106
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:55,893
Stay where you are!

107
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,920
Get away from me...

108
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,725
you monster.

109
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,658
Please remain in your homes.

110
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,866
Remain in your homes for the time being.

111
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,340
Stay home!

112
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:20,878
Everything is under control.

113
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,465
Stay home.

114
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,435
Are you okay? Where's Roven?

115
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,445
He was taken by the gods.

116
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:52,674
Please, Doron, we have to help him.

117
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,273
They are not gods.

118
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,977
They are invaders, pretenders.

119
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,520
Dangerous.

120
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:00,385
What about my father?

121
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:01,822
How will we get him back?

122
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,189
We will do the best we can, Mala.

123
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,854
For now, stay inside.

124
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:21,072
Don't touch that!

125
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:22,941
Lieutenant Stanton, speak to me.

126
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:25,173
Are you still operational?

127
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,883
Stop it. Now, now, now.

128
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,147
There's no need for violence.

129
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,052
Can't we communicate verbally?

130
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,989
You speak our language? How?

131
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,959
I have been programmed with the basic forms

132
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,119
of your vernacular, yes.

133
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,719
Does he speak our language?

134
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,264
What? No. No, no, no. Now listen...

135
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,960
I need to talk to him. Can you teach me his language?

136
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,195
Priorities first. He's dying.

137
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,830
Teach me or I won't help.

138
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,136
Lieutenant Stanton won't like this.

139
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,938
Hold still. Now, don't blink.

140
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:07,917
My head.

141
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:10,551
It's full of words.

142
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,255
What language is this? How did you do that?

143
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,524
A simple organic data download.

144
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:18,965
Now, please, you must help, or he will die.

145
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,229
Where do I begin?

146
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,272
Lieutenant Stanton requires oxygen,

147
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,102
a gaseous chemical element.

148
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,142
Colorless, odorless, tasteless.

149
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,700
Vital for respiration.

150
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:33,147
We need to seal this room and construct an air generator.

151
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:35,582
We must identify an oxygen-gathering plant

152
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,018
and incorporate it into this assembly.

153
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:41,113
Please gather all available plant life.

154
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,622
Hurry. He's beginning to suffocate.

155
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,957
Please initiate the procedure.

156
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,949
We did it!

157
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:53,323
What the...

158
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,057
Giddy?

159
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,158
Where am I?

160
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,259
In a dwelling used by the natives of this world.

161
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,496
I'm a prisoner?

162
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,004
I would say a guest.

163
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,166
Then let's not overstay our welcome. Get me Earth Force.

164
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,870
Negative. My transmitter was damaged.

165
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:12,039
Great. The ship. How's my ship?

166
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:15,482
Neutronic conductor overloaded, stabilizing gears fractured.

167
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:18,281
Yeah. But can she fly?

168
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:19,446
Negative.

169
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:24,455
Giddy, it's one of them.

170
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:27,587
This female's parental unit was taken by our scout ships.

171
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:30,565
My name is Mala. Can you help me save my father?

172
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:33,067
Lt... It speaks our language?

173
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:34,967
Giddy taught me your language.

174
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:36,471
You taught it?

175
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,235
Hey, Giddy, I never authorized that.

176
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:43,745
My apologies, but it was hard for you to issue the proper authorization

177
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:46,646
due to your asphyxiation.

178
00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:48,741
Are... Are you being sarcastic?

179
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,217
Lmpossible, sir.

180
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,151
That is not a feature of my programming.

181
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,584
A rescue mission.

182
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,928
Bring my father home, please!

183
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,542
Lieutenant Stanton!

184
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:18,411
Jim, come inside.

185
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:20,575
Stop!

186
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,777
Your lungs can only withstand this atmosphere

187
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:24,615
for approximately 27.6 seconds.

188
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:26,518
- Hurry! - Give or take.

189
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:27,954
- I can't breathe. - Oh, no.

190
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:29,218
No!

191
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:34,557
Hold on! I'm coming!

192
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,396
Hold on!

193
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:41,761
No!

194
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:45,763
Come on.

195
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,744
Come on.

196
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:54,778
Mala, hold on.

197
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,944
Help is on its way.

198
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,191
Giddy, pull!

199
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:49,360
Please, forgive him. He is frightened.

200
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:50,996
I scare him?

201
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,836
Everything different scares them.

202
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,843
They should've never left home.

203
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:58,870
I regret to say they have no choice.

204
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:02,281
This was their world... Earth,

205
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,683
a planet of plenty...

206
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:08,449
but not without its limits.

207
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,321
Eventually, humans exhausted

208
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:12,861
their world's natural resources.

209
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,227
Two neighboring planets... Mars and Venus...

210
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:16,925
were terraformed.

211
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,626
Colonies were established.

212
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:22,637
Two centuries later, the colonies demanded independence.

213
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:24,104
It meant war.

214
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:27,538
War.

215
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,204
All three planets were destroyed.

216
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,146
Everything was destroyed.

217
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:35,309
The survivors had only one choice:

218
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:37,215
To travel beyond their solar system

219
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,551
to the nearest life-supporting planet they could find.

220
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:44,354
The journey lasted several generations and led them here.

221
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:47,021
They named this planet Terra.

222
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,584
Your home?

223
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,455
You made this? For me?

224
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,970
Synchronous rotations, balance in the focal points.

225
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,771
This is really good. Where did you learn to do this?

226
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,644
All I did was put the pieces together. They felt right.

227
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:41,911
You're a natural.

228
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:43,781
Synchronous rotations.

229
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:47,914
Stabilizing gears fractured!

230
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,150
You can...

231
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:50,920
Help me repair the ship,

232
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,962
and I'll take you to your father.

233
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:56,921
Deal?

234
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,174
According to my holographic blueprint, this device meets all required specifications

235
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,338
for space travel, approximately.

236
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:51,410
Well, it's not exactly titanium,

237
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:54,547
but if this thing holds,

238
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:55,851
I can go home.

239
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,859
Remember, we have a deal.

240
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,793
What is this?

241
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,838
The Ceremony of Life.

242
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:13,068
We thank life for what it brings.

243
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:15,110
Even if it brings you war?

244
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:21,673
Earth Force recruited me when I was eight.

245
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:23,844
They recruit every kid on the <i>Ark</i>.

246
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,047
Intensive training, hand-to-hand combat,

247
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,387
flight simulation.

248
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,586
Be prepared, always on the ready.

249
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:36,188
The best, the finest, the last line of defense.

250
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,266
You wouldn't understand.

251
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:43,362
You only know peace.

252
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:50,267
Senn.

253
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:51,973
- What are you... - I had to see you.

254
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:54,414
You've locked yourself up for a week. What's going on?

255
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,043
- Huh? - Look, I know how you must feel.

256
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,644
- But I miss you. - I miss you, too.

257
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,282
I just... I need a little time. Please go.

258
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:04,622
Mala, the Ceremony of Life started. Are we still going together?

259
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,453
What's that noise?

260
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,521
- Did you make a new toy for Tuki? - Senn, wait.

261
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,498
I knew you were working on something.

262
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,972
- Mala, run! - Stop! Stop! You're killing him!

263
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:23,177
- I'll take him... - No!

264
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:28,340
I'm okay now.

265
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,476
- Please, listen. - It's one of them!

266
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:33,954
- I know. - What? You know?

267
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,321
- We can't let him go. - He's my friend!

268
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:38,360
- He'll betray us. - That's enough!

269
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,156
Mala, what... what have you done?

270
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:42,925
He said he would save my father.

271
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,158
Senn.

272
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,962
Senn!

273
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:49,870
She protected us, Giddy.

274
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,806
She defended us against her own kind.

275
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,866
"She"?

276
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,344
You said "she," not "it."

277
00:29:57,413 --> 00:30:01,008
We have to go. He'll be back... with company.

278
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,358
- What's wrong, Senn? - It's Mala.

279
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:15,590
It's Mala. She's protecting one of them.

280
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:18,565
There's one of those invaders in her house.

281
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,573
They were just here.

282
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,120
Did she build that?

283
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,987
I believe she did. Search the home.

284
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:47,755
Find them.

285
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,510
Hey, all clear.

286
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,665
The elders say a long time ago,

287
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,032
we were apart from nature.

288
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,536
We almost died.

289
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,375
But now we're together,

290
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:36,536
forever, in life.

291
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:38,637
Fascinating.

292
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,327
What are those big things up in the sky, Mom?

293
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,958
Look!

294
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,502
Mala!

295
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:13,407
Stop it! I'm over here!

296
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:14,540
Cease fire!

297
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:17,911
Damn it! Stop!

298
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:25,625
Hold your fire! I'm over here!

299
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,130
Why? Why are they doing this?

300
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:41,643
I don't know. It wasn't supposed to be this way.

301
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,214
Are you sure this is the place?

302
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:21,806
It was right here.

303
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,285
Traces under the recent snow layer suggest our craft

304
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:29,119
has been relocated from its position.

305
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:31,751
Someone took it.

306
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,380
Mala, come on! Keep up!

307
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,019
Strange.

308
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:04,252
This whole place kind of gives me the creeps.

309
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:07,625
The strangeness is increasing.

310
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,608
What is all this?

311
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:33,084
Lieutenant Stanton, all signs indicate the trail leads through there.

312
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:56,410
Those cloud sailers... what are they doing?

313
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:59,641
Not celebrating life, that's for sure.

314
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,541
War.

315
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:33,410
I guess our species have more in common than we thought.

316
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:57,963
Hey, come on.

317
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,168
- Where are we going? - Hitching a ride.

318
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:22,224
All right! There's my baby.

319
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:25,664
Looks like they're trying to figure out how it works.

320
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,861
Cockpit's still locked, though, so we got a chance to...

321
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,267
Jim...

322
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:32,136
Put down your weapon. You're surrounded.

323
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,175
Oh, no.

324
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:38,711
- Stop! Back off, or I'll kill her! - Jim!

325
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,270
- Jim! - Play along.

326
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:41,839
No! What are you doing?

327
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,010
- Jim! - Giddy, now!

328
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:45,917
- On my way. - No! Let me go!

329
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,592
I said get back!

330
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,130
Come on, Mala. They can't see you.

331
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:05,639
- You can stop fighting now. - You said you'd kill me.

332
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:07,299
It was just an act, Mala.

333
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:09,310
I was just pretending. I wouldn't hurt you.

334
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:10,743
Honestly.

335
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,109
Stop him!

336
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,978
- Hurry, Giddy! Hurry! - Coming.

337
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,544
Open the hatch.

338
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:23,819
Thank you.

339
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:28,788
You can do it. Come on. Hold it together.

340
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,292
Come on, baby. Come on.

341
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:37,765
- Not good? - No. Very not good.

342
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:42,337
- What the... - Uh-oh.

343
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:53,820
- Time to go? - Come on. Just one spark.

344
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,832
All right! There we go!

345
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,697
Come on, Giddy. We're going home.

346
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:12,367
Hold tight, okay? This could be a bumpy ride.

347
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,284
Your people... they made this?

348
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:00,753
Yeah. Don't let her looks fool you.

349
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,518
She hasn't aged too well.

350
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:07,255
Central Control, this is Lieutenant James Stanton.

351
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:09,490
Requesting permission to land.

352
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:10,588
Lieutenant Stanton.

353
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,930
Nice of you to finally find your way back to us.

354
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,936
Just had myself some shore leave, that's all.

355
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:18,802
You're cleared for landing in Deck A.

356
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:20,205
Alert! Alert!

357
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,505
We have depressurization on Deck C!

358
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,545
Seal the hatches! Hull breach!

359
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,275
No. Not again.

360
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,710
Welcome to my world.

361
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,764
Activate cockpit shield.

362
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:53,763
Hold on, Mala.

363
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:56,276
You have to stay here, okay? It's not safe.

364
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:59,404
Jim, I didn't come all this way to hide. I have to find my father.

365
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,813
I understand. I'll take you to him, I promise.

366
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:05,979
But you have to trust me. I'll be right back.

367
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:08,887
Please try not to touch anything, Mala.

368
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:22,894
How did you survive your crash?

369
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:27,340
After my ship went down, I woke up to find I'd been rescued and...

370
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,036
By whom?

371
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,544
A native.

372
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:32,807
Are the natives hostile?

373
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:34,212
No.

374
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:36,273
Do they have weapons?

375
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,148
Yes.

376
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,519
Advanced weapons?

377
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:53,925
"I'll be right back," he says.

378
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:41,506
Oh, no! Mala!

379
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:49,257
Hey, Jim. I missed you, bro.

380
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:51,155
Stewart.

381
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,989
I thought you were a goner.

382
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:56,758
Come on. It takes more than one rough landing to kill me.

383
00:41:56,832 --> 00:42:00,131
Mom and Dad would be really proud of you.

384
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:02,762
You're the man of the hour, Jim.

385
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:05,204
I mean, even General Hemmer wants to meet you.

386
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,900
Hemmer?

387
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,704
12 dead.

388
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,904
A dozen human beings.

389
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:14,005
One tarnished, worn-out security seal

390
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:18,041
way past its recall date, and gone...

391
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,145
12 valuable, productive lives.

392
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,748
How much longer do we have to wait

393
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:27,283
while this tomb crumbles around us?

394
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:30,354
When will this council give me the authority

395
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:32,229
to do what must be done?

396
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,066
Your plan calls for nothing less than the conquest of Terra...

397
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:39,971
an alien world, an occupied world.

398
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,009
My plan, Mr. President,

399
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:44,875
is the only way to salvage our species.

400
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:47,744
We are dying.

401
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,751
We are the last relics of humanity.

402
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,379
The future depends on us.

403
00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:01,093
We will have no future if we repeat the mistakes of the past.

404
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,756
We have superior technology and firepower,

405
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,164
impenetrable defenses.

406
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:09,226
The mistake would be not to act.

407
00:43:09,304 --> 00:43:12,296
Your plan's under consideration, General.

408
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:14,604
We will vote on it.

409
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,407
Vote! I ask for action, they vote.

410
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,846
What can we expect from civilians, sir?

411
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,907
You're a good soldier, Stewart,

412
00:43:22,984 --> 00:43:26,044
and, I understand, a brother of a war hero.

413
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:29,022
Thank you, sir, but I'm no hero.

414
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,990
At ease, Lieutenant.

415
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:34,324
You're the first man to distinguish himself in this conflict.

416
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:36,626
Congratulations.

417
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,189
I've had my eye on you for a while.

418
00:43:39,267 --> 00:43:42,293
James Stanton, 32nd Airborne.

419
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,099
How many left in the 32nd?

420
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:45,503
Eight, sir.

421
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:48,371
One short of a baseball team.

422
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:50,104
Let me guess.

423
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:53,204
Oxygen leaks, faulty fuel lines.

424
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:55,340
Engine failure?

425
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:59,217
Tired of watching comrades die for nothing?

426
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:03,451
We've come a long way. Terra is our prize.

427
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:05,618
A jewel hanging in space.

428
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:09,221
It has real water, not that chemical junk, and ground.

429
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:13,199
God, I'd like to feel steady ground under my feet one day.

430
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:16,635
Kids born on the <i>Ark</i> have never seen a blade of grass

431
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:19,230
or heard a bird sing.

432
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:21,070
Have you met the enemy?

433
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:23,906
I have encountered the native Terrians, yes, sir.

434
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,204
What are they like?

435
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,306
They're an interesting species, sir.

436
00:44:28,383 --> 00:44:30,817
They're peaceful and they're intelligent.

437
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:33,285
Their lives are filled with art and music.

438
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:35,414
I meant, can they fight?

439
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:38,186
They're not going to hit us with paintings, are they?

440
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:42,021
- I believe they can fight, sir. - Good.

441
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,122
Then they'll die with honor.

442
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,730
Giddy.

443
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,406
Don't be afraid. I'll get you out of here.

444
00:45:53,735 --> 00:45:56,101
Mala.

445
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,263
Father!

446
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,898
Father, I'm so sorry.

447
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,340
I'm gonna get you out of here.

448
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,070
Hey! A floater!

449
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,118
This is General Hemmer. Report.

450
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,313
We have a Terrian floater in Section D, sir.

451
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:14,446
Mala.

452
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,325
Get her!

453
00:46:20,762 --> 00:46:22,320
I love you.

454
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:32,799
Father! Father!

455
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,778
Father, no!

456
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:57,030
Here is your proof that Terrians

457
00:46:57,098 --> 00:46:59,430
are a hostile, murderous species.

458
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:02,299
Two more human lives lost.

459
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,304
According to Lieutenant Stanton's report,

460
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:06,465
the Terrian was seeking its parent,

461
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,338
one of the abductees.

462
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,400
The lines have been drawn.

463
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:13,641
We are human, they are alien.

464
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:16,309
Do not take sides against your own species.

465
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:18,978
General, our species has other options.

466
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:21,613
We need time to explore, to think,

467
00:47:21,689 --> 00:47:23,657
before we rush headlong into...

468
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:26,751
We have no more time.

469
00:47:26,828 --> 00:47:30,025
I have waited patiently for this council to act,

470
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:34,034
but our people are tired of dying in the rotting hull of this ark!

471
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:38,402
Therefore, I am assuming command.

472
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:40,532
The council is hereby dissolved.

473
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,133
You do not have the authority, General!

474
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:47,545
If I sin, let future generations judge me.

475
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,175
But mark this: Only thanks to me

476
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:52,685
will there be any future generations.

477
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:59,324
Hey, Jim, where you going, man?

478
00:47:59,394 --> 00:48:01,385
- This is wrong. - Wrong?

479
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,589
- General Hemmer says... - How can you follow him?

480
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:06,031
- We're soldiers. - I obey my commanding officer.

481
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,466
Hey, we obey the council.

482
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:11,869
Lieutenant Stanton, I would like you to join the attack force.

483
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,137
Respectfully, sir, I refuse.

484
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,201
You're our only war hero.

485
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:19,075
It's your duty to lead the way.

486
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,138
I lived with the Terrians, sir.

487
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:23,013
They're more like us than you can imagine.

488
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:24,847
Would it change your decision if I told you

489
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:29,618
we only have air on the <i>Ark</i> for another two months?

490
00:48:29,691 --> 00:48:34,253
This is mankind's last hope... the terraformer.

491
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:37,230
Currently, it provides sufficient oxygen for the <i>Ark</i>.

492
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:39,061
Once rooted in Terra's surface,

493
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:42,660
it will convert the planet to breathable air within seven days.

494
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:44,967
Seven days, Jim.

495
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:47,837
Very Biblical, don't you think?

496
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,935
The <i>Ark</i> will have residual air left for several more weeks,

497
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,105
but within that timeframe,

498
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:55,115
we will have won ourselves a planet.

499
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:56,980
What about the Terrians?

500
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,418
End hologram.

501
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,178
What?

502
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:03,451
Hello?

503
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,821
Mala!

504
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,826
Hello?

505
00:49:06,894 --> 00:49:09,795
The alien cannot see or hear us. Don't worry.

506
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,492
The air is pressurized for Terrian atmosphere.

507
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:14,296
It can breathe.

508
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:17,133
A human, however, cannot.

509
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,196
Anybody there?

510
00:49:19,274 --> 00:49:21,708
Hello?

511
00:49:21,776 --> 00:49:22,765
Stewart?

512
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:28,612
Where's Jim? Do you know who Jim is?

513
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:31,447
- Where are we? - Stewart!

514
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,386
- I can't breathe. - Somebody help me!

515
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:37,185
- Why? - A test, son.

516
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:39,692
The ultimate test. Whose side are you on?

517
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:40,887
Please, say something!

518
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,121
Stop! You're killing him!

519
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,496
No. You are.

520
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,831
Press that red button, and you can save him.

521
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,531
A demonstration of the terraforming technique will commence.

522
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:54,473
Your brother will breathe.

523
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,510
The Terrian will not.

524
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,238
Hello! Somebody, please help!

525
00:49:58,313 --> 00:49:59,837
There's gotta be another way.

526
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,748
There isn't. Us or them.

527
00:50:03,818 --> 00:50:06,343
- Somebody, he's suffocating! - Decide.

528
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,355
I can't breathe.

529
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,825
Somebody, please help!

530
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:29,408
Get away from me!

531
00:50:29,477 --> 00:50:31,502
What's happening?

532
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,179
Help! I can't breathe!

533
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:45,521
Help!

534
00:50:45,593 --> 00:50:47,424
I can't breathe!

535
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:49,656
I c...

536
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:52,495
Giddy, save Mala.

537
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,000
Confirm order.

538
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:56,730
Save Mala.

539
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:00,370
What's that robot doing?

540
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:02,807
- Otham. Cotters. - Get down!

541
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:10,279
Mala, your respirator.

542
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:12,612
Giddy.

543
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:14,621
This way.

544
00:51:16,724 --> 00:51:20,660
- Mala. - You?

545
00:51:20,728 --> 00:51:23,629
I'm sorry.

546
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,034
Mala, hurry.

547
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:33,397
- Giddy... - Follow me.

548
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:36,238
- Over there! - This way has a far lower mortality rate.

549
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,971
Stop 'em!

550
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,820
Mala, use the control stick. Fire missiles... now!

551
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:09,667
Incoming missiles!

552
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,850
Mala, stay calm.

553
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:29,530
We're falling too fast!

554
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:32,824
Prepare to eject.

555
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,030
Mala, grab onto my tail.

556
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:44,300
Oh, no!

557
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:33,155
Hey. About time you joined us.

558
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,121
Although, now that you're awake, um, I don't really know what to say.

559
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:41,896
I never should've told Doron about the invader.

560
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:45,496
Mala, you're my best friend, and I should've trusted you.

561
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:46,801
I'm sorry.

562
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:48,808
I'm sorry, too.

563
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:56,011
- Where's Giddy? - The creature you were with?

564
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:57,744
It's being held captive by the elders.

565
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,479
I have to save him.

566
00:53:59,554 --> 00:54:02,284
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

567
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:03,516
He's a tool of the enemy.

568
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:06,526
I can't release him, but I can take you to him.

569
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:11,732
What is this place?

570
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:15,701
Our past and possibly our future.

571
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,067
Warships?

572
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,309
We came close to destroying ourselves.

573
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:28,110
A small group of survivors formed the eldership.

574
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,481
They vowed to keep the past a secret

575
00:54:31,552 --> 00:54:34,988
and build a peaceful future.

576
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:38,253
But even gentle beings must defend themselves when attacked.

577
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:46,266
We've been watching the newcomers,

578
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:50,168
but we know nothing of their plans or intentions.

579
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:59,073
You're the only one who has been inside and returned.

580
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:02,343
No, I'm not the only one.

581
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:04,509
Please, help.

582
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:06,485
- Giddy! - Honestly!

583
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,387
- What are you doing to him? - We must dissect it to see how it works.

584
00:55:09,457 --> 00:55:13,120
- Oh, dear. - He is my friend. He saved my life.

585
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:16,027
Actually, Lieutenant Stanton saved your life.

586
00:55:16,097 --> 00:55:19,191
- He ordered me to protect you. - Jim?

587
00:55:20,668 --> 00:55:23,569
- I must say, this is not very pleasant. - Leave him alone!

588
00:55:23,638 --> 00:55:26,106
We need information on the enemy's strength and numbers.

589
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:30,007
- This machine might hold the answer. - So ask him, don't torture him.

590
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,637
Will you help us?

591
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:34,271
I cannot.

592
00:55:34,348 --> 00:55:35,872
Earth Force created me.

593
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,111
Jim commanded you to protect me.

594
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:41,018
- Will you disobey his orders? - Negative.

595
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,489
But if Earth Force invades, they'll destroy all life on this world,

596
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:46,685
including me.

597
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,161
Affirmative.

598
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:53,564
So the only way to protect me is to help us defeat Earth Force.

599
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:58,034
Well, if... Mala, l...

600
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:01,097
Lieutenant Stanton...

601
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:04,406
Your logic is tricky, difficult to compute.

602
00:56:07,715 --> 00:56:09,205
I will protect you.

603
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,756
Hey, Jim, look, I'm sorry about what happened

604
00:56:20,828 --> 00:56:22,420
in the enviro-chamber, but Hemmer said...

605
00:56:22,496 --> 00:56:24,760
How can you defend him, even now?

606
00:56:24,832 --> 00:56:26,857
He said it was the only way

607
00:56:26,934 --> 00:56:31,803
that we could be sure of your loyalties.

608
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:34,406
Sir!

609
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,975
My apologies, sir.

610
00:56:38,045 --> 00:56:41,537
I believe the Terrian must have reprogrammed my robot

611
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:43,242
during our captivity.

612
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:47,617
Like you said, interesting species.

613
00:56:47,688 --> 00:56:50,919
Full of surprises.

614
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:54,222
We've got a few surprises up our sleeve, too.

615
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:57,093
You're on the terraforming campaign, Lieutenant.

616
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,133
- That's an order. - Sir!

617
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:07,031
I don't know what happened to you on Terra,

618
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:09,133
but this is war,

619
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,940
and I'd feel a lot better knowing you had my back.

620
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,276
I've always looked out for you, kid.

621
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,213
I always will.

622
00:57:16,283 --> 00:57:19,775
Question is, will Hemmer?

623
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:19,780
The aliens breathe something called oxygen,

624
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,838
so our atmosphere is poisonous to them.

625
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,440
We must strike early while we...

626
00:58:23,517 --> 00:58:25,576
And that's where the terraformer should land.

627
00:58:25,653 --> 00:58:28,213
The formations of oxygen can spread more rapidly

628
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:31,190
to the native population centers, neutralizing them.

629
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,227
Air filters here and here

630
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:36,286
can alter your atmosphere into oxygen...

631
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:38,160
Before the enemy can strike the terraformer,

632
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:42,828
we must engage and destroy their primitive aerial attack force.

633
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,708
Men and women of Earth Force,

634
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:53,110
you hold the entire future of our species in your hands.

635
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,171
Brothers and sisters,

636
00:58:55,249 --> 00:58:57,444
we are engaged in a struggle for survival.

637
00:58:57,518 --> 00:59:00,885
Not only our own, but for our world.

638
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:05,722
Every living being on our planet depends on us.

639
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:09,456
If we fail, we fail them, too.

640
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:13,527
Your actions over the next few hours

641
00:59:13,601 --> 00:59:16,399
will either win ourselves a new home

642
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,904
or doom us to extinction.

643
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,464
I believe... I must believe

644
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,407
that in our darkest hour,

645
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,004
the very qualities which made us great will make us strong...

646
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:32,212
that love and mercy can triumph over hate and violence once more.

647
00:59:32,286 --> 00:59:35,278
Be loyal, be brave.

648
00:59:35,356 --> 00:59:40,487
Remember who you are and what you fight for...

649
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:42,392
Terra!

650
00:59:44,865 --> 00:59:48,596
- Hey, take care of yourself up there. - You, too, Jim.

651
01:00:25,773 --> 01:00:29,300
- Are you ready? - No, not really.

652
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:53,225
Return fire!

653
01:01:01,141 --> 01:01:02,130
Down!

654
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:05,178
The Terrians are flying new ships with more powerful weapons.

655
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,373
No one said we wouldn't suffer casualties, Lieutenant.

656
01:01:08,449 --> 01:01:11,577
Any soldier that dies today will live on in history.

657
01:01:11,652 --> 01:01:12,641
Press on.

658
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,762
Closing in on target.

659
01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:32,829
Closing. Closing.

660
01:01:35,009 --> 01:01:36,670
It's a trap!

661
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:47,915
There's too many! I need backup!

662
01:01:57,598 --> 01:01:59,031
They're coming straight at me!

663
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:01,033
Help! I need help! I need backup!

664
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,955
- Launch terraformer. - Aye, sir.

665
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,159
No.

666
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,798
Brace yourselves, men.

667
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,909
What is that?

668
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,722
Now.

669
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:43,527
Senn?

670
01:03:43,604 --> 01:03:45,538
It's really happening.

671
01:03:54,114 --> 01:03:57,777
0.5% of oxygen produced.

672
01:03:57,851 --> 01:04:03,084
1%, 3%, 5%.

673
01:04:03,157 --> 01:04:05,921
Half a million cubic pounds of oxygen generated.

674
01:04:05,993 --> 01:04:07,324
Accelerate.

675
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,392
Concentrate your forces on destroying that machine.

676
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:15,059
Follow me!

677
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,003
Gunfighters approaching on your left.

678
01:04:24,011 --> 01:04:25,273
Mala, watch out.

679
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,040
Senn, I need help!

680
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,253
Mala, don't worry. I'm right behind you.

681
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,228
Production up to 7%.

682
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,704
Minor damages on filters G through M.

683
01:04:52,773 --> 01:04:55,037
- Accelerate. - Sir?

684
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:59,168
Sir, production of oxygen at an advanced rate could be risky.

685
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:00,440
Do it!

686
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,583
That's it! You're damaging it!

687
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,384
General, we've lost air filters A through F.

688
01:05:10,457 --> 01:05:12,857
Production is down.

689
01:05:12,926 --> 01:05:15,326
Divert resources to the remaining filters.

690
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:17,727
Accelerate to maximum.

691
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:19,959
If we compress the terraforming process,

692
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:22,934
we'll be leaving ourselves extremely vulnerable to combustion.

693
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:24,664
That is a direct order!

694
01:05:24,738 --> 01:05:26,603
- Follow it! - Sir, yes, sir.

695
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,641
Second wave, attack!

696
01:05:30,244 --> 01:05:32,576
Phase 1 up to 25%.

697
01:05:32,646 --> 01:05:36,082
1.2 million cubic pounds of oxygen generated.

698
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:38,709
But the terraforming filters are under a lot of strain.

699
01:05:38,785 --> 01:05:41,151
How long before the process is completed?

700
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:44,247
In 12 minutes, the chain reaction will be irreversible.

701
01:05:44,324 --> 01:05:45,985
Hang in there, beautiful.

702
01:05:50,731 --> 01:05:52,961
Call in the reinforcements.

703
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:56,434
Orders received, General. We're on our way.

704
01:05:56,503 --> 01:05:59,438
Lock and load, people. It's crunch time.

705
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,673
I can't shake this guy!

706
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:16,147
Hang in there, Jim. I got this one.

707
01:06:22,262 --> 01:06:23,820
Jim, are you okay?

708
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,990
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a scrape.

709
01:06:28,368 --> 01:06:29,562
I've got a clean shot.

710
01:06:36,543 --> 01:06:37,976
Mala, hostiles from above.

711
01:06:45,185 --> 01:06:47,745
Sir, we're decimating the Terrian resistance.

712
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:49,152
Good.

713
01:06:49,222 --> 01:06:52,658
Keep production at maximum. Let's finish this.

714
01:07:25,692 --> 01:07:28,320
I see an opening. I'm going in.

715
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:37,560
- Mala, I can't shake 'em! - Hold on. I'll be right there.

716
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,409
No! Senn!

717
01:08:02,362 --> 01:08:03,659
No! No!

718
01:08:09,136 --> 01:08:10,433
No!

719
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:17,341
Enemy fighter on my tail. I need backup.

720
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,839
Hang tight. I'm on my way.

721
01:08:21,982 --> 01:08:25,213
Sir, 90% of oxygen dispersed.

722
01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:27,719
Five minutes until completion of campaign.

723
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:37,856
- You? - Oh, no.

724
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,437
Jim, where are you?

725
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:51,744
Just hold on, Stewart. I'm almost there.

726
01:08:51,812 --> 01:08:54,804
Mala? What?

727
01:09:05,358 --> 01:09:07,053
Jim, what are you doing? Just shoot!

728
01:09:15,936 --> 01:09:18,234
I can't hold on much longer! Shoot!

729
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:39,315
What are you doing, Jim?

730
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:47,832
Wait, wait, wait! Jim!

731
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:51,337
Incoming, sir! It's one of ours!

732
01:09:51,404 --> 01:09:54,066
Stanton? Pull away. Pull away!

733
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:57,868
Fire at that ship!

734
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:44,778
Come on!

735
01:12:57,357 --> 01:12:59,951
- Congratulations, Mala. - Good job.

736
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:08,256
Mala! Mala!

737
01:13:09,269 --> 01:13:10,896
Senn!

738
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,902
- Mala. - I thought you were dead.

739
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:17,670
Oh, me, too. I mean, you, too.

740
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:21,544
You did well, Mala. Very well.

741
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:23,411
It wasn't me.

742
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,747
He saved us.

743
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:27,787
He saved us all.

744
01:13:27,854 --> 01:13:32,314
But now they have no food, no water, no air.

745
01:13:32,392 --> 01:13:35,953
There's nothing for them to do but just wait for the end.

746
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:38,554
Never lose hope, Mala.

747
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:41,498
There are always alternatives.

748
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,118
- Hey, Senn. - Hey, what?

749
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,457
Race you.

750
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:12,930
I knew you were gonna say that. I don't know why I even answered.

751
