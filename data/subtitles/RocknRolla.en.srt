1
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:32,529
<i>People ask a question.</i>

2
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:36,402
<i>What's a RocknRolla?</i>

3
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:42,271
<i>And I tell them it's not about drums,
drugs and hospital drips.</i>

4
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:43,936
<i>Oh, no.</i>

5
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,777
<i>There's more there than that, my friend.</i>

6
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:49,619
<i>We all like a bit of the good life.</i>

7
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:51,255
<i>Some, the money.</i>

8
00:00:51,423 --> 00:00:53,253
<i>Some, the drugs.</i>

9
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:58,158
<i>Others the sex game,
the glamour or the fame.</i>

10
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,731
<i>But a RocknRolla, oh, he's different.</i>

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,299
<i>Why?</i>

12
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:09,906
<i>Because a real RocknRolla
wants the fucking lot.</i>

13
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:49,378
<i>My name's Archy,
formerly known as Archibald.</i>

14
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:51,811
<i>I work for a man called Lenny Cole.</i>

15
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:56,043
<i>And Lenny Cole has the keys
to the back door of this booming city.</i>

16
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:58,781
<i>Let me give you an example
of how Lenny works his magic.</i>

17
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:03,219
<i>Two years ago,
this property cost 1 million pounds.</i>

18
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:05,623
Today, it costs 5 million.

19
00:02:05,796 --> 00:02:06,888
How did this happen?

20
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:09,966
Attractive tax opportunities
for foreign investment..

21
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:13,298
restrictive building consent
and massive hedge-fund bonuses.

22
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,495
London, my good man..

23
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,800
is fast becoming the financial
and cultural capital of the world.

24
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:19,772
<i>London is on the rise.</i>

25
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:23,379
<i>Property value has gone one way: up.</i>

26
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:27,415
<i>And this has left the natives struggling
to keep a foothold in the property ladder.</i>

27
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:29,348
I can't teach you how to skin a cat..

28
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,513
but I can tell you a lot
about the money in bricks and mortar.

29
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,055
Like he said, it's going one way.

30
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:36,716
You need to see a lawyer.

31
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,562
We do need to see a lawyer.

32
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,222
Well, it looks like a great deal.

33
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:43,992
These are the plans.

34
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:47,194
It'll cost 10,
and it'll be worth 20 with planning.

35
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,635
But, first, you gotta give
the Councillor a drink.

36
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,604
<i>Same deal as before.
I'll tell them they've got the planning.</i>

37
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,574
<i>Thank you, Councillor.</i>

38
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,707
You'll get the planning.

39
00:02:56,881 --> 00:03:00,681
Take care of the Councillor,
and it'll move like shit through a goose.

40
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:02,877
We need help.

41
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:04,111
Lenny Cole.

42
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:05,653
Dog number one.

43
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:08,188
Bet he moves fast
and likes bricks and mortar.

44
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:11,192
I do move fast,
and I love bricks and mortar.

45
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,829
Property's always a safe bet..

46
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:16,125
but you gotta know what you're doing,
this ain't soft money.

47
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,700
<i>Because of these boys'
criminal records..</i>

48
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,064
<i>the bank won't lend them
the money they need.</i>

49
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,763
<i>Enter Mr. Lenny Cole..</i>

50
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:26,240
<i>London's money-loaning
and fast-moving property magician.</i>

51
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,207
Don't let me down, boys.

52
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:29,868
Come on, give me your hand.

53
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:32,608
<i>And this is where he waves
his black magic wand.</i>

54
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:35,308
Can't talk now,
but there's been a problem.

55
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:36,918
I can't get you the planning.

56
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:40,286
Sorry, boys, can't get the planning.

57
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:43,018
<i>Oh, isn't that an unpleasant surprise.</i>

58
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:44,990
<i>Because they don't wanna owe Lenny.</i>

59
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,562
He can't get the planning.

60
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,221
<i>That's right, sweetheart.</i>

61
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,456
Can't get the planning?

62
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:51,100
<i>You've been fucked.</i>

63
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,668
What do you mean
you can't get the fucking planning?

64
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,361
You owe me.

65
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:59,271
Right, I get the building,
you lose your share..

66
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,912
and I'm still out of pocket
two large ones.

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,808
Find it.

68
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,116
<i>They know they'll have to pay Lenny
before the month is out.</i>

69
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:11,914
<i>Because Mr. Cole has ways of making life
very, very uncomfortable.</i>

70
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,318
We better find it.

71
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,288
<i>What they don't know
is that Lenny controls the councilors..</i>

72
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,860
<i>the judges and the lawyers.</i>

73
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:21,156
<i>No planning permission will be given
until Lenny wants it.</i>

74
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:24,062
<i>And now that he owns the building,
he wants the permission.</i>

75
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,100
Hello, Councillor?

76
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:28,161
Yeah.

77
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:32,507
Yeah, I hear you got that car
you wanted.

78
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,170
You're very generous, Len.

79
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:36,778
Right, now, sort that planning out,
will you?

80
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,807
- Sorted, Lenny.
- Good.

81
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,552
What's wrong with you, Archy?

82
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:49,192
Was that not a bit strong, Len?

83
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:52,786
They come from the same place as you.
You're gonna clean them out.

84
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:54,454
The same place as me?

85
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,963
Do I look like a fucking immigrant?

86
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,795
No one gave me a leg up.

87
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,928
They need a little bit of fear,
otherwise, they'll come up against me.

88
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,838
They need a little lesson, don't they?

89
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,468
<i>And that is an example
of how Lenny works.</i>

90
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,951
<i>Now, today is Lenny's big day.</i>

91
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:21,216
<i>He's hit the big time..</i>

92
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:25,259
<i>because a new Russian billionaire
desires Lenny's property contacts.</i>

93
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,297
<i>He wants planning permission
where the law won't allow.</i>

94
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,865
Lenny Cole is here.

95
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,728
<i>Lenny will come through..</i>

96
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:35,031
<i>but he will rape that Russian
for every ruble he can get.</i>

97
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:36,468
Nice to see you, Uri.

98
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:39,336
Good. Come and take a seat.

99
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:43,471
Excuse me if I am hasty,
but I have a busy day.

100
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,615
- Oh, that's all right.
- Sit.

101
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:51,420
I can see we are very much alike,
you and I, Lenny.

102
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:54,023
We like to get things done.

103
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,425
What's it going to cost me?

104
00:05:56,927 --> 00:06:01,557
First, let me make it clear exactly
how we can help you benefit from this deal.

105
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,927
Without me,
you'd be waiting five to 10 years..

106
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,002
before you got permission
to erect your arena.

107
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,435
Secondly, with British law
as it so stands..

108
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,802
Lenny, how much?

109
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:16,978
Seven million euros.

110
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:26,783
I expect the guarantee that I have consent
within six months and no red tape.

111
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:28,254
Oh, you got it.

112
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:29,586
Consider it done.

113
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:33,091
- Drink?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,932
That's a nice painting, Uri.

115
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:42,401
It's got depth, you know.

116
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:45,040
That picture has brought me nothing
but luck, Lenny.

117
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,233
It's my lucky picture.

118
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:48,038
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

119
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:49,572
You like?

120
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:51,338
Yeah.

121
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:53,783
Take it for a while.

122
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,247
Maybe it will give you luck.

123
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,252
Oh, no, Uri, I.. You know, I couldn't.

124
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:00,857
We are partners now, I insist.

125
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,425
I will get it sent around to your house.

126
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:06,961
You can give it back to me
when our deal's finalized.

127
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,257
Hm?

128
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, I thought you lot drank vodka.

129
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,468
Whiskey is the new vodka.

130
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,197
You're not joining me?

131
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,170
I don't drink.

132
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:23,939
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

133
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,382
- You all right, Len?
- Yeah.

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,858
Because you're looking a bit pink.

135
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,824
Get us some water
and a wet wipe live-o, will you, Turbo?

136
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,398
Right away, Len.

137
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,560
He tried to poison me, the dirty Cossack.

138
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:49,600
Look, stop messing about,
just give me the bottle.

139
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,365
Sorry, Len.

140
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,031
How is the billionaires club?

141
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:57,069
Well, I tell you what, this Communism
didn't slow him down, did it?

142
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,341
I'll tell you what, Arch.

143
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,149
We've hit the big time here.

144
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:06,216
Well, what's wrong?
Where's the famous Archy smile?

145
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,951
You gotta watch yourself with this lot.
I mean, times are changing.

146
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:11,531
They ain't no respecters
of the old school.

147
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:12,959
Oh, bollocks.

148
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,896
There's no school like the old school,
and I'm the fucking headmaster.

149
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,797
That's why he come to me.

150
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,459
Got it?

151
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:23,168
Yeah, got it.

152
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:29,346
You think you should have lent him
your lucky picture?

153
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:31,879
It makes the peasant feel royal.

154
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:35,143
Don't spoil it,
we need him at the moment.

155
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:36,817
I want that consent.

156
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:39,388
Call the accountant
and get her to clear the money.

157
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:43,288
<i>If Uri's gonna turn over seven large ones
to grease Lenny's contacts..</i>

158
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,951
<i>he's gonna need it in cash.</i>

159
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,256
<i>And for that,
he needs his personal accountant.</i>

160
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,165
<i>Meet the very gifted
and the financially creative Stella.</i>

161
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:54,634
You know why you get deals?

162
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:58,138
Because those sad, fat, old men like it
when you swear at them.

163
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:00,777
They shake like cocktails
and sweat like Semtex..

164
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,038
when you raise that posh, little voice.

165
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:06,879
You, my love, are a rare commodity.

166
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:10,250
Now, come on, give your Bertie a smile.

167
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:12,821
I don't feel like smiling.

168
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,322
I'm a 30-year-old accountant
married to a homosexual lawyer.

169
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:20,028
I'm a beard without kids, Bertie.

170
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:23,427
For a marriage of convenience,
this can be quite inconvenient.

171
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:29,202
<i>Stella, we need to talk.</i>

172
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:31,135
Yes, she's right here.

173
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:32,673
It's Omovich.

174
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:34,105
You sure he isn't gay?

175
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:36,177
<i>But what the Russian doesn't know..</i>

176
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:39,679
<i>is that his accountant
has got bored of the safe life..</i>

177
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,412
<i>and is looking for excitement
in all the wrong places.</i>

178
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,854
<i>Welcome to the Speeler.</i>

179
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:51,482
<i>This hot little house of crime is home
to a particularly nefarious group..</i>

180
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:54,687
<i>of individuals known locally
as the Wild Bunch.</i>

181
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:57,424
There's no way you're gonna get a five,
understand, Bob?

182
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:00,469
- They've got nothing on you, son.
- What are you talking about?

183
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:03,265
Fred, they've got a grass.
They've got an informer.

184
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,337
Got a rat with a roach smoking a canary.
Got more information than the Internet.

185
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,876
All right, ladies.
Cookie, how you doing, son?

186
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,139
Cookie, do you want in?

187
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:14,716
I did promise the twins
I'd take them fishing, but fuck it.

188
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:18,980
- Throw us in for a quick spin.
- Hey, Mumbles, can I have a word?

189
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,856
No.

190
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:25,220
Mumbles, I'll make it worth your while.

191
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:26,419
Coming, dear.

192
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:30,192
<i>But in the world of crime,
there's always coincidence.</i>

193
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,927
<i>And the very men she needs
to fuel her thrills..</i>

194
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:36,004
<i>are the very men
that owe Lenny two large ones.</i>

195
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,936
What's happening?

196
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,509
You know that lady, the posh pup?

197
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:42,668
The one that likes a bit of the rough life?

198
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:46,442
The little dangerous accountant. You
haven't heard from her in a little while.

199
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:48,642
- I know.
- Well?

200
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:51,082
Well, she's offered us
a bit of work, right?

201
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:53,883
But, I mean, like, proper work.

202
00:10:55,426 --> 00:11:00,830
Now, normally, I would just turn her down,
but considering our current situation..

203
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,022
Let's have a meet.

204
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,013
I've got one just like that at home,
but with a little boy fishing.

205
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:24,318
Is that what they call humor
where you come from?

206
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:28,254
Is that what they call art
where you come from?

207
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:32,692
You are quite the entertainer,
Mr. One Two.

208
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:35,057
And you're also late.

209
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:38,229
Please, don't be late.

210
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:48,043
I've got some work,
thought you might be interested.

211
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:49,941
Go on.

212
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,445
There are two accountants taking out
7 million euros from a bank I know.

213
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:56,915
And it won't be protected.

214
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,351
Twenty percent for me, as normal.

215
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,514
The details are in here.

216
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,155
Anything else?

217
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,351
Yeah.

218
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:09,431
I don't want this coming back to me,
so you could give them a black eye.

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,328
It might help.

220
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,961
Just a black eye, nothing more.

221
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,801
Very well, Mrs. Baxter.

222
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,943
A black eye it is, then.

223
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,741
Nice shoes, by the way.

224
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,442
Thank you.

225
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,783
You'll be able to afford a pair of your own
in a couple of days.

226
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:44,256
"Troubled rock star, Johnny Quid,
is missing, presumed dead yesterday.."

227
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:47,461
when he fell from the side of a yacht
thought to be owned..

228
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:51,038
"by a prominent high-street
fashion magnate."

229
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:54,509
Sorry, I don't know what to say.

230
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:59,011
Yeah, well, I bet he took a few people
with him in his hot little crack pipe.

231
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:06,513
We will never mention this again,
all right, Arch?

232
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,892
Look, tell the Councillor
to stop fucking about..

233
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:16,191
with his little bat and balls
and send him inside.

234
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:22,365
Oh, that is sensational, Councillor.

235
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,104
Did you have lessons as a boy?

236
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:27,307
Fancy a cool down?

237
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,605
Bit of a chat with Lenny?

238
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,509
- You know Jackie?
- No.

239
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:37,176
No, Archy, please, don't say anything.

240
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:41,085
Don't you worry about her.
She's a very good friend of mine.

241
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:42,892
And a member.

242
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,084
Oi, Jackie.

243
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,623
You fancy a runaround
with the Councillor?

244
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:49,890
Only if he's wicked.

245
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,167
What does she mean by that?

246
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:58,734
What would you like her to mean by that,
Councillor?

247
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:03,379
Come on.

248
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:06,447
There we are, plans and papers.

249
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:10,144
<i>When you're in bed with Len,
he likes to sweeten a cash deal.</i>

250
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:12,585
Would you like a cigar?

251
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:14,414
I don't mind if I do.

252
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:20,530
<i>He wants you sitting in the front row
with a new car sitting in your driveway.</i>

253
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:24,326
<i>Len's skill lies in his ability
to know where your back needs scratching.</i>

254
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,628
That's a nice lighter.

255
00:14:27,403 --> 00:14:30,931
Eight grand they wanted for it,
the greedy toads.

256
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:32,665
And I paid it.

257
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:34,241
You know why?

258
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,173
Tell me, Lenny.

259
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,213
It's all about the details.

260
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:43,748
Is our little deal in there too?

261
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:45,384
<i>Look at Lenny.</i>

262
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:48,389
<i>Fucking playing with himself,
he's so proud.</i>

263
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:50,890
<i>He only paid a hundred pounds
for that lighter..</i>

264
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:53,859
<i>he's making the Councillor sweat
like he stole it himself.</i>

265
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,827
I wouldn't forget about that.

266
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:57,563
The important things first.

267
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:01,636
<i>You got to hand it to Len,
because he ain't half a naughty bastard.</i>

268
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:03,533
I'll leave that with you.

269
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:07,143
<i>Now, the Councillor just needs a few hours
with a right rotten tart..</i>

270
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,176
Can't stay here chewing the fat all day.

271
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,041
Man's got a living to make.

272
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,807
I'll phone you in tomorrow.

273
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:15,746
<i>And he'll be in there like swimwear.</i>

274
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,681
Take care of him, Jackie.

275
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:20,687
Lenny, you forgot your lighter.

276
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:22,250
No, it can't be mine.

277
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:25,755
It's got your name on it.

278
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,088
All right.

279
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:31,756
<i>Nothing's gonna stop Lenny
from his big Russian deal.</i>

280
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,537
Yeah, I knew he'd like the lighter.

281
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:37,503
It was a nice touch, wasn't it?

282
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:41,133
Yeah, she's a good girl, Jackie.
You give her another drink.

283
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:43,209
Yeah, you're right.

284
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,144
He wouldn't give me
his favorite painting, would he..

285
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,581
if he didn't mean business?

286
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:54,121
Yeah, I've took it off the easel,
and I've put it on the wall.

287
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,951
Yeah, it looks mag..

288
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,615
Archy, I've been.. Fuck.

289
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:58,886
Oh, fuck.

290
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:00,620
Archy?

291
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,231
Archy, I've been robbed.

292
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,832
<i>What?</i>

293
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,793
<i>Hello?</i>

294
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,429
I said, I've been robbed.

295
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:12,039
Yeah.. I don't know when.

296
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,232
It's the painting.

297
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:17,576
Yeah, it's the one that Uri gave me.

298
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,576
All right, loaned, for fuck's sake.

299
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:25,985
Archy, this is not good.

300
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:28,385
That's his favorite painting.

301
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:31,392
His lucky painting.

302
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:33,628
Yeah, all right.

303
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:37,197
Come around here and bring the troops.

304
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:38,623
Yeah.

305
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:41,429
<i>Oh, fuck it, this isn't
what I want to hear.</i>

306
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:44,664
<i>When Lenny's wheels come off,
he's no good to anyone.</i>

307
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,832
<i>Now, he's gonna stick it
straight on my lap.</i>

308
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,879
<i>And Archy is gonna have to go to work.</i>

309
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,408
Where was it, Len?

310
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:02,553
Well, let's just take a wild stab
in the dark, shall we, Bandy?

311
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:06,922
Archy, slap him, send him to school
because I can't take no more of this.

312
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:08,358
Now, you sort this out.

313
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:13,935
Get that painting back, bring me a body,
because I'm going to back to bed.

314
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:23,375
Bandy, you ever ask a stupid question
like that again, you see Danny there?

315
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:24,570
He's gonna slap you.

316
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:27,915
I'm sorry, Arch.
I was just trying to use initiative.

317
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:29,847
Danny, slap him.

318
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:35,750
With the right, Danny, properly.

319
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:41,130
No, no, no, come on, do it properly
with the back of the right hand.

320
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:44,461
- What is this, a tennis match, Arch?
Slap him.

321
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,938
Oh, for fuck..

322
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,273
Like this.

323
00:17:54,944 --> 00:17:57,470
Now, if you can master a slap like that..

324
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:00,412
there's no need for your clients
to hold back.

325
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:04,179
They will open up
like a fountain full of words.

326
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:07,279
No need for strong violence, no, no.

327
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,325
They're transported
back to their childhood.

328
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,160
Putty in your hands.

329
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:14,057
Ask Bandy.

330
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:16,457
Look, thinks he's back at school.

331
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,132
But he never went to school, Arch.

332
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:23,300
You want a slap as well, Daniel, eh?

333
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,936
Now, if the slap don't work,
you cut them or you pay them..

334
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:30,773
but keep your receipts
because this ain't the Mafia.

335
00:18:30,948 --> 00:18:33,576
Now, get out there, look for the painting.

336
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,496
- Hello.
- Hi.

337
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:49,689
Bye.

338
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:52,801
If you just put the bags in the car,
close the door, walk away.

339
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:56,163
Ahem. Now, now, boys, do as you're told.

340
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,798
Put the bags in the car,
walk away and keep smiling.

341
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,345
Sorry, is this a robbery?

342
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:06,180
Yes, it is a robbery. Now, fuck off.

343
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,742
Thank you.

344
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:15,086
- Very good, Mr. One Two.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Mumbles.

345
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,126
Yeah, give me the keys.

346
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:28,601
Thanks.

347
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,441
Yeah, very funny.

348
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:45,410
Oi.

349
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:48,423
Where's reverse?

350
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:51,152
You have to lift up the knob
under the..

351
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:53,796
- Gear stick.
- Ah.

352
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,025
Oh, yeah. Now, fuck off.

353
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:20,615
I know an electrician
that could copy one of those for you.

354
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:25,084
Might take him
a couple of minutes, mind.

355
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:28,160
Welcome to the nouveau riche,
Mr. One Two.

356
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:30,657
Here's one for you too, Mrs. Baxter.

357
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,064
<i>Mm, tres chic.</i>

358
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:40,865
It's a little bit heavier
than it looks on a calculator, isn't it?

359
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:44,440
I see you didn't think
much of the black eye.

360
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,207
I would like to have obliged.

361
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:50,079
But from a professional point of view,
just didn't seem natural.

362
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:54,155
- Mm.
- Until the next time?

363
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,987
Maybe.

364
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:13,200
The development has been underway
for four years..

365
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:16,903
and will be completed
within another two.

366
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:19,643
The area covers 12 acres..

367
00:21:19,816 --> 00:21:22,842
and it will become one
of London's premier residences.

368
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,953
Excuse me, gentlemen.

369
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,422
What is it?

370
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:58,211
Victor, Victor.

371
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,926
<i>- Yo, Archy.
One Two.</i>

372
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:14,730
Hey, I got Lenny's bit of scratch.

373
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:15,997
What, you got all of it?

374
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:19,903
Yes, it's burning a hole in the floor,
so come get it before it melts my boots.

375
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:21,407
I'll come down to Speeler.

376
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:24,008
Hold on.

377
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:26,876
Gotta go, got another call. Len?

378
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,746
Archy, the Russian didn't come through
with the money.

379
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,115
<i>Don't worry about that,
the Councillor can wait.</i>

380
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,619
<i>I got some good news for you.</i>

381
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,587
<i>One Two and Co. have
come through with the scratch.</i>

382
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:39,156
- What, all of it?
- So they say.

383
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:40,853
<i>Where'd they get that from, then?</i>

384
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,124
No idea.
Ask no questions, you'd hear no lies.

385
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,564
Listen, all I gotta do now
is find your painting.

386
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,134
Yeah, well, make sure you do find it.

387
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:50,497
Oh, look, I've gotta go.
There's another call.

388
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:51,663
Hello?

389
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:54,309
I have all my people waiting, Lenny.
You can't let me down.

390
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:57,310
It's a delay.
That's all, Councillor, just a delay.

391
00:22:58,382 --> 00:22:59,940
Well, get back to me soon.

392
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:01,846
Yeah, of course.

393
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:04,784
Wanker.

394
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:09,423
I shook your hand, I've nicked your
rings. You didn't know that, did you?

395
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,191
Yes, that's right.

396
00:23:14,865 --> 00:23:17,628
- I can't. Tell you what I'll
do, I give you 50. Gary.

397
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:19,726
See you.

398
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:21,028
Hello, Archy.
Hello.

399
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:22,796
Come over here.

400
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:25,769
Hello, Arch.
What brings you down here?

401
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,135
What do you want, tickets?

402
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:28,936
I want the Tank.

403
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:32,569
Right. Well, you won't see him
on the cobbles, not this time of night.

404
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:37,345
He don't like the cold, see?
He's at the end of that street there.

405
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,954
<i>Tank runs
the biggest ticket-tout organization..</i>

406
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:41,453
<i>in the West End of London.</i>

407
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:45,083
<i>He knows more about what moves
on the streets than the rats themselves.</i>

408
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:49,493
<i>Tank is a fortified world
of disgusting information.</i>

409
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:52,259
A word.
- Hello, Arch, what are you doing here?

410
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:54,299
I need a word.

411
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,439
Don't stand out there
on the cobbles.

412
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:57,630
Step into my world.

413
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,078
<i>Well, perhaps the birds and the..</i>

414
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,150
Great movie this, Arch.

415
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:11,219
They've had it redone.

416
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:14,557
Glorious picture.

417
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,221
And the sound, well, it's exquisite.

418
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:21,787
Could you turn it down a bit
so we could have a word?

419
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:23,397
Oh, where are my manners?

420
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,397
Sorry, Arch.
What do you want, tickets?

421
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:28,298
Don't want tickets.
I'm looking for a painting.

422
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,905
A classic painting,
been nicked out of Lenny's house.

423
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:34,770
You got more feet on the street than
coppers on the beat, so I want you to help.

424
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:38,711
I'll tell you what,
I'll leave you a little livener.

425
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:41,509
Here's a couple of large
to get some tongues wagging.

426
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,517
<i>- Yeah.
Master, are you Fred?</i>

427
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,917
It is Fred.

428
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,355
<i>For years,
there's been a well-hidden informer..</i>

429
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:53,189
<i>that's sent us all down
at one point or another.</i>

430
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:57,163
<i>And now Bob is looking
at a five-stretch due to this grass.</i>

431
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:02,064
So, tell me, Handsome,
your mom can't be very happy.

432
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,036
Not with you getting a five-stretch.

433
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,674
Please, Fred, please, not again, yeah?

434
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:10,178
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know I don't mean to offend.

435
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:12,644
<i>But what makes the situation worse..</i>

436
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:18,185
<i>is everybody knows this dirty fucking
rat is still lurking somewhere among us.</i>

437
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,380
Evening, gentlemen.

438
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:23,583
Oh, lovely hat, Fred, lovely.

439
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,125
Who gives a fuck what you think?

440
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:28,230
Okay, gentlemen, let's go.

441
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:33,362
First, my colleague Paul
will be modeling the gray wolf.

442
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,933
I must apologize
for my assistant's handicaps.

443
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:40,974
He has unusually long arms
and an alarmingly small neck.

444
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:43,407
I agree it doesn't seem
the right time of year..

445
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,209
to be acquiring a coat
with such thermal efficiency.

446
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,010
It is the middle of fucking summer.

447
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:51,914
However,
Christmas is always around the corner.

448
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,749
Where did you get these junkies, eh?

449
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,516
What's this, a fucking double act?

450
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:58,751
Get on with it,
give us the price and then leave.

451
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:02,326
All in good time, gentlemen,
all in good time.

452
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,330
Next up,
we have a very much sought-after affair..

453
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:09,232
seen in very, very glossy magazines.

454
00:26:09,772 --> 00:26:14,403
<i>Junkies, as any junkie will tell you,
are not to be trusted.</i>

455
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:18,105
<i>They take what doesn't belong to them,
not because they're thinking..</i>

456
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,748
<i>but because they're junkies.</i>

457
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:21,941
What? It's only fire.

458
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:24,450
<i>Selling stolen fur coats
in the middle of summer..</i>

459
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:27,181
<i>would not seem peculiar
to the average junkie mind.</i>

460
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:31,661
The famous but rare black bear.

461
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:35,828
Found in the dark mountains
of Siberian Calcutta.

462
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:38,092
Get an eyeful of that stripe,
gentlemen, eh?

463
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:41,567
Oh, have a look,
it's a 6-foot skunk, isn't it?

464
00:26:42,972 --> 00:26:47,307
And all of this could be yours
for the staggeringly low..

465
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,977
<i>- Yeah, hello.
It's Archy.</i>

466
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:50,839
<i>- Hello, Arch, come up.
- Open up.</i>

467
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:54,039
Come up, son.
Right, you two, out of here, live-o.

468
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:55,980
Come on, back door, fuck off.

469
00:26:56,152 --> 00:26:58,551
<i>The Wild Bunch have had to put
extra money on top..</i>

470
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,246
<i>to ignite Lenny's contacts.</i>

471
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:03,017
<i>And maybe, just maybe,
Lenny's magic wand..</i>

472
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:07,391
<i>can make Bob's legal paperwork
mysteriously disappear.</i>

473
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:09,087
You all right, Fred?

474
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,492
Arch.

475
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,826
Mumbles.

476
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,526
Arch.

477
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:16,167
- Bob.
Yeah, Archy.

478
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:17,567
One Two.

479
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,230
Arch.

480
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:21,644
I see you brought
your biggest gorilla with you.

481
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:25,314
That's very unkind.

482
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:28,207
You wanna be careful, One Two.

483
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,218
You don't wanna catch another cold,
do you?

484
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,617
Speeler's a bit quiet today, Fred.

485
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:36,816
Everything all right?

486
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:38,983
It's good as gold, thanks, good as gold.

487
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:40,595
Good.

488
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,493
So come on, where is it?

489
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:48,229
What, can't you smell it?

490
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:50,231
No, I can't.

491
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,407
Look at that, we could make a team.

492
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:01,811
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Arch?

493
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:04,819
Oh, by the way, this is for you.

494
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:07,683
You buy yourself a new pair
of football boots or something.

495
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:09,346
Really?

496
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:12,324
You ain't half a funny bastard, ain't you?

497
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:15,125
Good night, ladies.

498
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:21,896
They say there are only two days
you enjoy a boat.

499
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:25,397
The day you buy it
and the day you sell it.

500
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,440
According to my figures,
that sounds about right.

501
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:30,044
What are you gonna do?

502
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,976
Beauty is a cruel mistress.

503
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:33,876
I must remember that line.

504
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,539
Be my guest.

505
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:38,243
- Can I pour you a glass?
- No.

506
00:28:38,421 --> 00:28:39,547
Thank you.

507
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:41,814
You know, I like you.

508
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:44,959
I like the way you are.

509
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:48,996
Always thinking about business,
very professional.

510
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:52,728
Well, that's what you pay me to be,
isn't it?

511
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,566
Tell me about your husband.

512
00:28:56,972 --> 00:28:58,269
My husband is a lawyer.

513
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:00,432
I hear he's very good at what he does.

514
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:03,112
Maybe we can have some work for him.

515
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,510
Tell me, what do you do for fun?

516
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,744
Have I offended you in some way?

517
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:17,324
As you said, I'm a professional,
you're my employer.

518
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:20,691
So as long as it stays that way,
why would I be offended?

519
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:25,965
You see, Victor?
This is what I am talking about.

520
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:28,496
This is what I like about this country.

521
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:29,865
They understand hierarchy.

522
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,530
You do your job, I do mine,
and everyone gets along.

523
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,169
Now, back to business.

524
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,503
We have had security problems.

525
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:40,980
And to cut a long story short..

526
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:45,177
I need another 7 million euros
lost in the books.

527
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:49,623
Mr. Omovich, I'm the best at what I do.

528
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:51,624
I could certainly cover
some of that money..

529
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:52,818
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

530
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:55,624
But even I can't hide 7 million
from the tax man.

531
00:29:57,232 --> 00:29:58,927
But if you are so good..

532
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:00,830
You devil.

533
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:02,163
Let me think about it.

534
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,502
There are some options
I've tried to leave open.

535
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:09,269
Thank you.

536
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:30,154
- Come on, Bobby boy, cheer up.
- What have I got to cheer up about?

537
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,460
I'll be locked up in an 8-by-10
tomorrow night.

538
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:37,003
Bob, that's tomorrow night, okay?
So tonight is takeoff time.

539
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:40,769
And we have got a party
planned for you, my man.

540
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:43,845
We got a couple of grams of hurry up
and four Jack the Rippers.

541
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:45,708
We've got the Harris twins.

542
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:50,175
Probably the most expensive escort girls
ever to have escorted.

543
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,115
Got the night off from the Russians..

544
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:55,723
and they have been greased down
just for the Bobski.

545
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,932
Okay, well, I see
that cheered you up.

546
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,060
It's not that I'm not
grateful, it's just..

547
00:31:06,836 --> 00:31:07,859
What? It's just what?

548
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:10,029
You wouldn't understand.

549
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:12,230
Come on, Bobby boy, that's not fair.

550
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:14,239
I'd understand anything
coming from you.

551
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,613
Would you?

552
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:21,242
Bob, you're my best mate.

553
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:28,451
You see, I don't want the strippers,
One Two.

554
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:30,892
Okay.

555
00:31:31,627 --> 00:31:33,391
I want you.

556
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:46,932
Dirty bastard.

557
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:53,777
You dirty bastard.

558
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,779
Bob, I know all your girlfriends,
all of them.

559
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:01,515
I told you, you wouldn't understand.

560
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:04,250
What, I wouldn't understand
that you're a fucking homo?

561
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:06,586
You're Handsome Bob.

562
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:10,163
You're Handsome Bob, the fucking
lady-killer, that's who you are.

563
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,856
Do you hear me, Bob?

564
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:15,266
I mean, I've had showers with you, man.
You've seen my fucking cock.

565
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:17,201
I should have just kept my mouth shut.

566
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:19,432
Right, you should have kept
your mouth shut.

567
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:21,873
We should've just gone
and done the strippers..

568
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:23,672
like Handsome Bob would've done.

569
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:26,178
You should drown the cat
instead of letting it out.

570
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:29,340
No, no, not you. Not fag Bob.

571
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:50,201
I am so sorry.

572
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:54,532
Well, I'm sorry.

573
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,269
No, I'm sorry.

574
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:58,505
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

575
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:01,376
No, I'm fucking sorry, Bob, all right?

576
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,780
I went over the top a bit.

577
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:06,580
And it was a bit
of a fucking surprise, Bob.

578
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:09,019
It was a bit of a broadside.

579
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:10,853
It's fine. It's fine.

580
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,621
Five years, you know.

581
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,928
I don't know if I can handle it.

582
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:28,038
I don't know what I was thinking, Bob.

583
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:32,574
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with being a poof or being a gay..

584
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:36,616
or whatever it is you call it,
I don't know.

585
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:41,017
I mean, there's gonna be plenty
of your lot in there.

586
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:43,291
You'll probably love it.

587
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:47,451
Oh, God.

588
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,134
What..?

589
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:57,134
What exactly is it that you..?

590
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:02,009
That you wanna do to me, then, Bob?

591
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:06,444
Tank, come in.

592
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,375
You want a drink?

593
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:13,146
No, thanks, Archy.
Not till the sun's past the yard hour.

594
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,389
Ooh. Nice office Lenny's
got here, isn't it?

595
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:26,391
Like that,
Scandinavian pine posing as English oak.

596
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:28,469
Nice touch, that.

597
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:30,434
Ooh.

598
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,934
- Whistler.
- Come again?

599
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:36,635
Nineteenth century,
Beaufort Hunt, master of hounds.

600
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:38,036
Is that right?

601
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:41,706
You know a man's cultured
when he's got a Whistler on the wall.

602
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,411
Go on.

603
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:54,726
Now, you know why they call me Tank,
don't you, Archy?

604
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:57,126
It's because you're a dirty,
big black bastard.

605
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,961
Think tank, Arch.

606
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:02,001
Nothing gets past the old think tank.

607
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:03,894
Nothing.

608
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:08,708
So I thought I'd fire a few questions
into the right direction.

609
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:12,780
Thought I'd come see you because it looks
like I got news about your painting.

610
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,849
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

611
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:18,643
Right, let me tell you how this works.

612
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,983
You're going in the drink,
and I'm gonna have a cup of tea.

613
00:35:22,157 --> 00:35:25,615
Beneath your feet
is the famous river Thames.

614
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:29,030
I just hope for your sakes
you can hold your breath..

615
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:31,358
for as long as it takes
my kettle to boil.

616
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:35,128
After that, I'm gonna ask you a question,
just one question.

617
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:36,998
You're gonna give me a name.

618
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:38,503
And if it's the right name..

619
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:41,733
I'm gonna send you home warm and dry
in a fresh set of clothes.

620
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:46,405
If it's the wrong name,
you'll be fed to the crayfish.

621
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:49,244
They're American, these crayfish.

622
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:50,510
Big, hungry bastards.

623
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:53,677
And like most things American,
they've eaten the natives..

624
00:35:53,856 --> 00:35:56,757
but they've still got room for more.

625
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:58,085
Show him one, Charlie.

626
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:03,632
All right, see you, enjoy.

627
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:08,632
No, no, no. They got money.

628
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:10,829
They stole the fucking money.

629
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:13,668
I swear, I wouldn't fucking lie to you,
please.

630
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:15,538
No, no, no.

631
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,802
Oh, stop, stop.

632
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,969
No, don't.

633
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:22,583
The American crayfish
was introduced in the '20s.

634
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:25,083
A guest, if you like.

635
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:29,449
And like most guests having a good time,
they didn't wanna leave.

636
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,092
Next 50 years..

637
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,492
they consumed all the local crayfish,
wiped them out.

638
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:41,394
And then, they started eating each other.

639
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:46,336
That's the thing about greed, Arch.

640
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:48,701
It's blind.

641
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:53,110
And it doesn't know when to stop.

642
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,608
That's why I'm here.

643
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,152
To keep order.

644
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:03,318
Danny, hose him down.

645
00:37:22,978 --> 00:37:27,278
Right, who's got that painting?
One name.

646
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,273
Johnny.

647
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:30,976
Johnny Quid.

648
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:35,920
The singer from the group,
the Quid Lickers.

649
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:38,389
This hasn't worked, has it?

650
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,862
- How can a dead man sell you a painting?
- No, he's not dead.

651
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,693
He's not dead, he just tried selling us
that painting and he changed his mind.

652
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:48,802
- He's got, like, an obsession with it.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

653
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:50,938
Archy, put him back in
before I shoot him.

654
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:53,735
No, please, I know who he is.
We went to school together.

655
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:54,932
I wouldn't lie to you.

656
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,306
I don't lie.
I've never lied in my life.

657
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,777
Now, please just let me go.
I don't wanna get..

658
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:06,215
Len, can I have a word?

659
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:08,550
I really wouldn't lie to you.

660
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:18,190
- Your boy ain't dead, is he?
- Don't you dare call him my boy.

661
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:22,701
Oh, you know what I mean.
Your ex's boy, your stepson.

662
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:25,565
He had a set of keys to the house,
didn't he?

663
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,300
He just won't fucking die,
that cockroach.

664
00:38:28,476 --> 00:38:31,809
That junkie's seen more funerals
than a fucking undertaker, he's poison.

665
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:36,007
I tell you, the next world war
will have his name written all over it.

666
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:40,278
Look, you go see..

667
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:44,449
if you can find them two flash idiots
that used to be his manager.

668
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,458
What are they called?

669
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,393
Greek and Minnie?

670
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,896
- Roman and Mickey.
- Yeah, whatever.

671
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:55,094
Because if anybody can find
that smoking crack pipe, they can.

672
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:56,922
No, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

673
00:38:56,936 --> 00:38:58,498
That's exactly what I do.

674
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:01,507
The dry ice, Mickey.
I need the fucking dry ice.

675
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:03,440
My show just doesn't work without it.

676
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:04,873
Hold on a second.

677
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:07,742
If you would've asked me yesterday
for dry ice..

678
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:10,476
I would've got the driest ice
the world could find..

679
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,052
but you didn't ask me.

680
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:15,213
You asked me for two cases
of Johnnie Walker Black Label..

681
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:18,416
and four ladies of the pole,
and I got them for you, didn't I?

682
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:19,958
Yes.

683
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:21,891
Yes, you did, I do confess.

684
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:28,025
But, Mickey, you are the manager,
I'm the rocker.

685
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:31,695
You got on the hat. Why don't you
just pull something out of it?

686
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:34,239
My hat is deep and full of magic.

687
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:38,244
I got rabbits, handkerchiefs and ladies
of the pole drinking Black Label.

688
00:39:38,614 --> 00:39:40,775
I got smoke machines,
bubble machines..

689
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:45,545
I even got love marines,
and still the hat goes deeper.

690
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:47,382
All right?

691
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:50,224
But there ain't no motherfucking dry ice.

692
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:52,019
Okay.

693
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,157
You made your point.

694
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:58,893
But tomorrow,
might be quite nice to have some dry ice.

695
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:03,472
- You read this?
- What?

696
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:07,005
"Singer extraordinaire, Johnny Quid
fell off a boat, " they said.

697
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,905
"Missing, assumed dead, " they say.

698
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,443
Our Johnny?

699
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:15,572
How many rock stars by the name Johnny Quid
do you think there are in the universe?

700
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:18,083
Only thing he fell off is his junkie spoon.

701
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:20,744
He's no deader
than them shoes you got on.

702
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:23,983
He'll be gearing himself up,
happy as a clam in a fisherman's net.

703
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,559
June, how dead is Johnny?

704
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:28,253
If he's dead,
that's the third time this year.

705
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:31,295
Rockers like that never die.

706
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:36,632
They just wither and give me pain.

707
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:04,092
Now, listen to me, boy. Listen.

708
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:07,132
I never did like you,
neither did your real dad.

709
00:41:07,302 --> 00:41:08,327
You're a reject.

710
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:12,201
A wrong and a fucking fairy in the mirror
that I inherited from your mom.

711
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:15,137
But she ain't with us no more,
so it's just you and me.

712
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:17,643
Now, next week,
you're going back to school.

713
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:21,271
The most expensive fucking school
in this country, I might add.

714
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:23,315
And then you'll be gone
for a whole term.

715
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:28,947
In the meantime, show some gratitude
and keep the fucking music down.

716
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:20,242
Go on, John.

717
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:22,070
Jog it on.

718
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,612
I can't, Pete.

719
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:27,742
The painting's got me.

720
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:30,077
That's what art does to you, Pete.
It gets you.

721
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:33,016
You'd get a good few notes for that.

722
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:37,487
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why not?

723
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:40,561
Because you are street scum, Pete.

724
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:43,755
You're in need of a good education.
That's what you need.

725
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:46,264
But your dad
didn't give a shit about you, did he?

726
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:48,300
And that's why you're on the gear.

727
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:51,166
The gear is your surrogate father.

728
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,797
Leave off, John.
What, is this shrink time?

729
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:59,043
Come on, Pedro.

730
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:04,112
I'm your sponsor, doctor.

731
00:43:04,286 --> 00:43:07,744
I'll be your dad if you feel
a bit of regression coming on.

732
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:11,655
But first, we need a drink in our hands.

733
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:18,460
<i>My dad used to make me watch Bonanza
every Sunday after church.</i>

734
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,925
Well, that's got
to have done some damage.

735
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:24,333
- All those guns, nuns and cowboys.
- You think?

736
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:25,938
It wasn't all bad.

737
00:43:26,108 --> 00:43:27,871
He sometimes made me laugh too.

738
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:30,170
Well, now we're onto something.

739
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:32,041
Did he ever interfere with you?

740
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:35,210
You know, touch you inappropriate-like.

741
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:37,614
He tickled me, if that's what you mean.

742
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:40,983
In psychological circles,
there's a technical term for that scenario.

743
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:42,880
There is?

744
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:45,322
Monsteroustickalotis.

745
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:47,018
You what?

746
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,054
Your dad was a tickling monster.

747
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:52,458
Oi, that's my drink.

748
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:54,862
Fuck you, sing-along.

749
00:43:55,036 --> 00:43:57,061
You're no help,
and stop calling me Pedro.

750
00:43:57,472 --> 00:43:58,701
Oi.

751
00:44:00,943 --> 00:44:01,967
Come on then, boy.

752
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:05,704
I'll have you and your girlfriends.
I'll do the lot of youse.

753
00:44:07,382 --> 00:44:10,079
Do I not look like a pothouse?
Six foot down the bar.

754
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:13,914
Go on, jog on, walk on,
goodbye, bon voyage, fuck off.

755
00:44:19,661 --> 00:44:21,561
- Was I good or what, Pete?
- Yeah.

756
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,391
It's all in the eyes.

757
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:25,760
Junkies, I shit them.

758
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:40,878
Roman, Mickey.

759
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:45,782
I tried to stop them,
but they couldn't be stopped.

760
00:44:45,954 --> 00:44:49,047
- I think they just wanted..
- Just wanted to have a chat.

761
00:44:49,224 --> 00:44:51,157
I'm sorry, Mickey.

762
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:53,893
Yeah, don't worry about it, June.

763
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:56,054
Why don't you go have another lunch?

764
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:58,864
Come over here, babe.
We can have it together.

765
00:44:59,902 --> 00:45:02,268
Yeah, sorry to intrude.

766
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:04,637
They call this a litchi, don't they?

767
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:06,103
Litchi.

768
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:08,139
Litchi, litchi.

769
00:45:15,117 --> 00:45:16,447
Mm.

770
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:19,211
It's tasty and exotic.

771
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:20,746
A bit like your June.

772
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,981
Thanks.

773
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:28,958
Can we help you?

774
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,394
Yeah. You got an act
called the Quid Lickers.

775
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,534
We did, yeah.

776
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:42,132
And there's a singer called Johnny Quid.

777
00:45:42,311 --> 00:45:43,938
There was.

778
00:45:44,112 --> 00:45:47,139
Well, I'd like to see Mr. Quid.

779
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:50,045
I'd like to see him too,
but that's gonna be tricky.

780
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,550
According to the papers..

781
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:54,347
the only songs Mr. Quid's
gonna be singing are hymns.

782
00:45:54,523 --> 00:45:56,320
And I shed a tear.

783
00:45:56,492 --> 00:46:01,724
I shed a tear for all those bone tops
that read the papers and believe that shit.

784
00:46:02,197 --> 00:46:04,563
But did you see his body?

785
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:06,724
Did you see him smacked up
and cracked up..

786
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:09,597
with his tongue on his chin
and his cock in his hand..

787
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:12,400
swinging from the rafters
like a real RocknRolla?

788
00:46:12,574 --> 00:46:14,201
No, you didn't, did you?

789
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:16,969
And nobody else
fucking did either, did they?

790
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:19,204
Because he ain't dead.

791
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,976
He's alive, alive-o somewhere,
selling cockles and mussels..

792
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:26,177
and a very important painting
that doesn't belong to him.

793
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:29,847
I'm sorry,
what does this have to do with us?

794
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:34,726
You have 12 licenses
within a jurisdiction which I control.

795
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:37,161
So if you wanna play on,
do what I tell you.

796
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:42,603
I can tell what you're thinking now.

797
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:44,465
Well, there's not much you can't do.

798
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:47,005
Slow down, Tinkerbell.

799
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:52,204
<i>You'll never sing the same
If your teeth ain't your own</i>

800
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:59,016
Wait, so you guys
are gonna take care of him?

801
00:46:59,188 --> 00:47:01,519
What do you think we are, gangsters?

802
00:47:02,224 --> 00:47:03,554
That's not my style.

803
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:07,494
So do us all a favor
before you catch a cold.

804
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,101
There he is.

805
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,402
You were missed in court this morning.

806
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:19,039
Not very compassionate, is it?

807
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:21,369
Not turning up to your amigo's funeral.

808
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:25,269
Yeah, everyone else was there,
except you.

809
00:47:25,713 --> 00:47:27,806
And I got the feeling
that the only person..

810
00:47:27,983 --> 00:47:31,213
that Handsome
really wanted to see there was you.

811
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:35,882
All right, well,
what are you saying, Fred?

812
00:47:36,057 --> 00:47:38,925
What the fuck are you getting at?
Come on, out with it.

813
00:47:39,094 --> 00:47:41,119
Whoa, leave it.

814
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:43,927
We all know how much you loved Bob.

815
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,862
What exactly do you mean, loved Bob?

816
00:47:48,503 --> 00:47:49,992
Guess who.

817
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:52,829
Prosecution lost the paperwork.
I'm off ski.

818
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:54,202
Case is closed.

819
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,077
Five years.

820
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:09,487
You're supposed to be in fucking..

821
00:48:09,657 --> 00:48:11,922
One Two, phone for you.

822
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:19,733
Someone lose a bit of paperwork,
did they, One Two?

823
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:22,233
- Very clever.
- Yeah, well, next time, you remember.

824
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:25,567
That's exactly why you pay Lenny,
understood?

825
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,902
<i>- All right.
- Good.</i>

826
00:48:32,514 --> 00:48:33,947
How did you get this number?

827
00:48:34,115 --> 00:48:35,981
Oh, I can get any number.

828
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,675
I work with numbers, don't I?

829
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,414
One point for initiative,
and two to tell me what's on your mind.

830
00:48:42,523 --> 00:48:45,516
My old man's having a party tonight,
and he needs some smarties.

831
00:48:45,693 --> 00:48:48,128
It's a liberty,
but I thought you might know someone.

832
00:48:48,297 --> 00:48:50,992
<i>- Sorry, not my thing.
- And I've got a bit of work for you.</i>

833
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:54,864
<i>You can bring your friends.
Lots of interesting people there.</i>

834
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:58,199
<i>- Rich and famous, great and the good.
- All right.</i>

835
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,931
<i>Let me see what I can do.</i>

836
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:31,864
Okay?

837
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:48,653
Yeah, a nice drop of whiskey.
That, I must say.

838
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:50,849
I suppose you're wondering
why you are here.

839
00:49:51,025 --> 00:49:54,586
Well, I assume you just wanted to check
that everything was kosher my end.

840
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:57,630
I was surprised
when you didn't come through..

841
00:49:57,798 --> 00:49:59,061
at the appropriate time.

842
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:02,032
But then,
I reckon you must have your reasons.

843
00:50:02,204 --> 00:50:03,228
I understand that.

844
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:06,271
And I wouldn't like things
to go wrong either..

845
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,467
which brings me conveniently
to my next point.

846
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:12,436
Ever since the painting,
you know, my lucky painting..

847
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:18,677
hasn't been hanging on my wall,
things have not been so lucky.

848
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:22,311
I know this is a rude request because
we have not concluded our business..

849
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,085
but I feel as though I need it.

850
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:27,824
Yeah.

851
00:50:33,802 --> 00:50:36,599
Fucking hell.
He's given you that bar tan again.

852
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:39,865
- You wanna lay off that vodka.
- Shut up, Arch.

853
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,567
Everything all right?
- No, it fucking ain't all right.

854
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:45,338
He wants his painting back.
His lucky painting.

855
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:46,981
Painting?

856
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:50,277
- That is a bit of a problem.
- You should've seen his eyes.

857
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:53,579
I swear, they changed color.
They went fucking red.

858
00:50:54,588 --> 00:50:57,523
They don't care
whose soil they're on, this lot.

859
00:50:57,858 --> 00:51:00,521
They could buy up half of London
without breaking a sweat.

860
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:01,719
You're small-time.

861
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:03,797
They click their fingers,
we'd be ether.

862
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:07,764
You speak to me like that again,
I'll cut your fucking tongue out.

863
00:51:07,936 --> 00:51:10,597
I run this town. You got that?

864
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:12,295
Me.

865
00:51:13,442 --> 00:51:16,639
Anyone who thinks he's rude enough,
let him raise a finger..

866
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:20,646
because I'll tear his fucking arm off.

867
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:24,675
Do you understand that, Archy, do you?

868
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:27,021
Yeah, yeah, I understand that.

869
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,652
How about that?

870
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:34,625
Johnny Quid's daddy. Mm.

871
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:38,065
How did that go under the radar?

872
00:51:38,733 --> 00:51:39,893
Why doesn't anybody know?

873
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:42,661
Would you want anyone to know
if that was your dad?

874
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:45,670
Would we have signed him
if we would've known?

875
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,702
I know what.

876
00:51:47,876 --> 00:51:51,641
We better give
that man something, anything.

877
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:55,543
A bed that's been slept in,
a bone for his dog, some token of effort.

878
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:59,619
If you want to find Johnny,
you have to see Cookie.

879
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:07,284
Who are you?

880
00:52:08,262 --> 00:52:10,253
My name's Cookie.

881
00:52:10,764 --> 00:52:11,891
You must be with Stella.

882
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,630
No, we're the SWAT team.

883
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:16,001
Well, you better get swatting.

884
00:52:20,742 --> 00:52:22,231
This is gonna be a scream.

885
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:23,740
Tallyho.

886
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:26,175
Fred, get them in.
Come here.

887
00:52:26,347 --> 00:52:29,442
Why me?
- Because you look like one of them.

888
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:32,682
Take that chewing gum off your feet
before you start dancing.

889
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:34,253
Follow me, boys.

890
00:52:40,295 --> 00:52:42,786
So who the man?

891
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:45,659
- Cookie, I think that's your cue.
Who's got the gear?

892
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,563
Think I'll have a little dance first.

893
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:50,829
- Fred, you fancy it?
Yeah, go on.

894
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:55,199
Look at the girls.

895
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:01,547
Excuse me, darling.
What the fuck are you doing here, Bob?

896
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:04,849
Well, all the boys were coming,
and I didn't have any plans.

897
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,748
I thought I was gonna be locked up.

898
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,719
So I thought I'd come and celebrate.

899
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:12,251
- Do you fucking mind?
- Of course I fucking mind, Bob.

900
00:53:12,661 --> 00:53:15,061
What happened last night, okay,
between you and I..

901
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,255
that's our little secret, all right?

902
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,793
It happened because you're
supposed to be going to prison today.

903
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:24,268
If you tell anybody
about what happened last night, anybody..

904
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,239
- Oh, good evening, gentlemen.
Hi.

905
00:53:29,411 --> 00:53:31,208
- Fuck..
- Help yourselves to drinks.

906
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,811
Okay, definitely, yeah.

907
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:37,280
- Go that way.
- She's nice.

908
00:53:37,452 --> 00:53:38,885
Go that way.

909
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:44,324
Then I'm like, "Bertie, take a
Quaalude, " you know what I mean?

910
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,728
All right.

911
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:51,389
Drink?

912
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:53,760
- Dance?
- You're a dancer?

913
00:53:54,668 --> 00:53:56,398
Am I a dancer?

914
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,800
Shall we set the record straight?

915
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:03,070
See, my dad was a dancer,
and his dad before him.

916
00:54:03,244 --> 00:54:07,545
So finally, it percolated
through the old DNA.

917
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:12,780
You're not joining me?

918
00:54:13,788 --> 00:54:15,186
Sure.

919
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:17,257
I like to dance.

920
00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:35,333
No.

921
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,206
I'm Bertie. It's my party.

922
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,007
So you're part of the Wild Bunch?

923
00:54:40,181 --> 00:54:42,547
Stella says you're dangerous.

924
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:45,476
I am dangerous.

925
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:05,864
Is your friend part of the Wild Bunch?

926
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,065
No.

927
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:09,003
He is the Wild Bunch.

928
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,688
- I know all about your type.
- Oh, yeah?

929
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,327
- How's that, then?
- I'm a criminal lawyer.

930
00:55:28,496 --> 00:55:31,987
And I know a secret
about your part of town.

931
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,862
What's that, then, Bertie?

932
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:36,731
You have an informer
in your neck of the woods.

933
00:55:38,106 --> 00:55:39,835
What's his name?

934
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:42,237
You have to pay for secrets.

935
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:45,277
Now, now, that's not very nice, is it?

936
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,248
What's your price?

937
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:53,114
And remember, I am dangerous.

938
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:56,347
I want to meet the Wild Bunch.

939
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:02,893
See that man sitting on the sofa?

940
00:56:03,063 --> 00:56:05,123
Oh, the queen who's screwing me out.
- Yeah.

941
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,427
- It's a bit hard to miss him.
- Do me a favor.

942
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:10,695
- Go and chat him up, will you?
- Fuck off, who do you think I am?

943
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:14,204
No, no, he's a bigtime lawyer
who reckons he knows about an informer..

944
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:15,603
in our part of town.

945
00:56:15,777 --> 00:56:17,438
Now, you were facing a five-stretch.

946
00:56:17,612 --> 00:56:20,012
And I figured
you might be interested, ain't it?

947
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,411
Mm-hm.

948
00:56:27,722 --> 00:56:28,746
- Hey.
- How you doing?

949
00:56:28,922 --> 00:56:29,947
All right.

950
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:32,456
- So we got another job on again.
- Yeah?

951
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:33,753
Same one as before.

952
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:37,260
Cor, it's all going down in here.
It's the den of iniquity, I tell you.

953
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:39,092
I hear you have a secret.

954
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:41,461
And by the looks of you,
you have more than one.

955
00:56:41,635 --> 00:56:43,603
I don't want to talk about work.

956
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:48,641
If you tell me who this informer is,
then we can talk about anything you want.

957
00:56:49,244 --> 00:56:51,677
I gotta get myself a breath of fresh air.
Catch you..

958
00:56:51,846 --> 00:56:54,280
Oi, One Two, I owe you one.

959
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:58,407
This lot are doing more bugle
than a brass section.

960
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:01,414
- I'm happy for you, Cookie.
- Yeah.

961
00:57:07,262 --> 00:57:11,130
If he's an informer,
you'll have his depositions, poems.

962
00:57:11,298 --> 00:57:15,463
My, my, not just a pretty face.

963
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:18,195
How'd you know
about those sort of things?

964
00:57:18,706 --> 00:57:20,003
Give me your mobile.

965
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:21,769
- What?
- You heard me.

966
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:23,467
Do as you're told.

967
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:28,646
Ooh.

968
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,175
That's nice.

969
00:57:33,054 --> 00:57:38,583
Here, we'll go for a drink next week,
and I'll tell you all about it.

970
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:43,760
All I need is some paperwork.

971
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:50,528
Wait up, sing-along.

972
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:54,135
Where's the rush?

973
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:55,469
All right.

974
00:57:55,844 --> 00:57:58,074
- What's wrong?
- Get that Archy on the phone.

975
00:57:58,246 --> 00:58:00,179
- I think we got a problem.
- What?

976
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:02,612
How much is it gonna cost
if we shut down tonight?

977
00:58:02,784 --> 00:58:04,842
- Eleven thousand, three hundred..
- All right.

978
00:58:05,018 --> 00:58:06,849
Go out there
and see what's going down.

979
00:58:17,297 --> 00:58:20,358
You, what do you think
you're doing?

980
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,434
What do you think?
We're trying to get in.

981
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:24,036
Go home, wasters.

982
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:27,902
- It costs money to get in here.
- Yes, I'm aware of that, my good man.

983
00:58:28,076 --> 00:58:29,509
Mr. Archy.

984
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,610
No, you can't shut us down.
We got an act on.

985
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,873
<i>- And I'm interested?
- We got a band on-stage right now.</i>

986
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,277
- Find him.
- I understand.

987
00:58:37,452 --> 00:58:40,751
Listen, but I have to keep the club open.
You hear that shit?

988
00:58:40,922 --> 00:58:42,150
Run along, junkies.

989
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:44,916
Oi, lookie but no touchy.

990
00:58:45,592 --> 00:58:47,059
Get off of him, you slag.

991
00:58:47,228 --> 00:58:49,889
He is absolute class.

992
00:58:54,302 --> 00:58:57,465
I gotta keep the club open.
We got 400 people in here.

993
00:59:03,378 --> 00:59:05,346
Leave it, John. I'm happy.

994
00:59:05,512 --> 00:59:08,481
I'm all right down here, mate.
Let's call it a night, eh?

995
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,777
- I'll fucking show him happy.
- Oh, no.

996
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:25,461
Fancy some more talent, boy?

997
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:29,028
I'd like to make a complaint.
What's your name?

998
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:32,900
Jog on, boy,
before I grind your bones to make my bread.

999
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:24,815
Night, night.

1000
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,784
- Fucking mutt.
Look at this, man.

1001
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:30,829
- It's a damn revolution going on outside.
- No shit.

1002
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:34,628
If we wanna keep our license
and the lights on, we gotta go find Cookie.

1003
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:44,134
We'll put rock salt in the shells,
stick them in the revolver.

1004
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:47,644
If they get large, we'll bang a couple
into them, should slow them down.

1005
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:49,476
And they won't know the difference.

1006
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,552
And then Bob's our driver, and..

1007
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:55,347
- I don't wanna use Bob.
- What?

1008
01:00:55,523 --> 01:00:57,490
- I don't want to use Bob.
- He's our driver.

1009
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:59,956
The Wild Bunch is not complete
without the driver.

1010
01:01:00,128 --> 01:01:01,492
No.

1011
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:03,996
What's happened
between you and Bob, then?

1012
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:12,737
Mumbles, there is something about Bob
that I don't think you know.

1013
01:01:12,907 --> 01:01:15,239
What's that, then? That he's a poof?

1014
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:19,713
- How the fuck did you know that?
- Come on, everyone knows he's a flamer.

1015
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,510
You're the only one that doesn't.
No. He likes the boys.

1016
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,585
It's sausage and beans
all day long, mate.

1017
01:01:25,753 --> 01:01:27,583
What the fuck are you talking about?

1018
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:32,222
- Did he make a pass at you?
- Yes, he fucking did.

1019
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:33,985
So, what's the problem?

1020
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:36,858
It was supposed to be his last night.
You took care of him.

1021
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,125
That's what friends do for one another.
Well done.

1022
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:42,398
And I won't tell the chaps.

1023
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:47,467
What the fuck do you mean?
You won't tell the chaps what?

1024
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:50,634
So, what did you do? Did you suck his..?

1025
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,780
Hey, hey, that's enough, all right?

1026
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:56,849
What the fuck is going on here?

1027
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:58,550
What? Did you suck his..?

1028
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,880
- You must have touched him.
- No.

1029
01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:02,579
Hold on.

1030
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:07,123
I'm not gay, all right, Mumbles?

1031
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,130
He just asked
if I wanted a dance, that's all.

1032
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:16,731
Was it a slow dance?

1033
01:02:25,545 --> 01:02:27,411
What has he done to me?

1034
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:30,914
Mr. One Two, I think there is something
you should know about our Bob.

1035
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:34,717
Who do you think looked after your mom
before she died..

1036
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:37,449
when you was doing a two-stretch?

1037
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:40,025
Because it wasn't me,
and I'm your best fucking pal.

1038
01:02:40,193 --> 01:02:41,626
No, it was Bob.

1039
01:02:41,795 --> 01:02:46,358
Bob was around there six times a week
making sure she was looked after.

1040
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:51,130
You tore your mom's heart out when you
went away. Bob did his best to put it back.

1041
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,570
I tell you something, Mr. One Two.

1042
01:02:56,744 --> 01:03:00,907
If I could be half the human that Bob is
at the price of being a poof..

1043
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,811
I'd think about it.

1044
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:07,648
Not for too long,
but I'd have to pause, you know?

1045
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:14,025
And the kid looks up and goes,
"Well, what do you fucking think?"

1046
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:19,023
That joke was a lot funnier
when I told it to you last week.

1047
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,061
Can I have a word with you, Cookie?

1048
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:22,668
Treacles, would you mind?

1049
01:03:22,836 --> 01:03:24,998
On your toes. Five minutes.

1050
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:31,934
Hey.

1051
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,074
We need to know where Johnny Quid is.

1052
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:39,913
You should probably be the first
to know, but isn't he..?

1053
01:03:40,086 --> 01:03:44,079
I know. Come on, you know
and I know that nothing killed Johnny.

1054
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:47,891
Come on, Cookie, you've been fucking
his life up for the past five years.

1055
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:50,530
Come on, show our boy a little love.

1056
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:56,661
You ever bought a ticket
to the junkies' boneyard, Roman?

1057
01:03:57,338 --> 01:04:02,036
It's an unpleasant place
called curl up and die.

1058
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:04,304
Might sound like a hair salon..

1059
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:07,447
but it don't fucking look like one,
I can tell you.

1060
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:14,353
It's a terrible sight,
and a horrible sound listening to a man..

1061
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:19,018
sucking his soul
through the hole in the pipe.

1062
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:22,219
And even worse
when he tries to tear it back.

1063
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,757
I've been there, and I've done that.

1064
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:27,764
He has been here, and he has done that.

1065
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:32,065
And then I nailed that demon
in a smoke-proof coffin.

1066
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:34,333
And I did it all with Johnny.

1067
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:36,572
I love that man.

1068
01:04:36,744 --> 01:04:38,871
He's what you call class.

1069
01:04:39,045 --> 01:04:41,378
If you had any brains, Roman,
you'd love him too.

1070
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:46,418
You know, his music sales have gone up
a thousand percent in two weeks.

1071
01:04:48,588 --> 01:04:51,751
You see, Johnny, the crackhead knows..

1072
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:55,918
that a rocker
is worth more dead than alive.

1073
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,498
Silly world, isn't it?

1074
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:04,028
Mr. Quid does not get his gear from me.

1075
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:07,402
He has to travel far and wide.

1076
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:08,871
But do leave me your number.

1077
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:13,342
And if the dead feels like calling..

1078
01:05:13,847 --> 01:05:15,974
you'll be the first to know.

1079
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,233
I'll have the painting for you
in a couple of days.

1080
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,931
I had it locked up with some other goods.
You know, I was keeping it safe.

1081
01:07:18,108 --> 01:07:21,077
And then Archy goes and loses the key.

1082
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:22,836
Don't you, Arch?

1083
01:07:24,514 --> 01:07:27,746
So I'm not trying to be funny,
but I've got this payment tonight..

1084
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:32,081
and if there's any chance
of having the money..

1085
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:40,356
Where the fuck has he gone, then?

1086
01:07:41,097 --> 01:07:44,625
I don't know. But I don't think
he was too impressed with that story, Len.

1087
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:48,965
Something wrong with these immigrants.
I don't trust them.

1088
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:51,072
I think we're being set up.

1089
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:54,108
I don't know how,
but something is wrong.

1090
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,106
I can smell it with my sniffer.

1091
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,777
He doesn't have the balls or the brains.

1092
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,818
He's a crook.
Small-time, backhanding crook.

1093
01:08:11,362 --> 01:08:13,420
I think he's trying
to make fool out of you.

1094
01:08:13,597 --> 01:08:15,461
Adjourn the meeting.

1095
01:08:31,948 --> 01:08:34,349
Oh, my God, you're a mess.

1096
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:36,912
There you go.

1097
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,923
Are you all right?

1098
01:08:42,091 --> 01:08:45,027
That is a rhetorical question, I hope.

1099
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:52,698
I'll have a water, please,
with a big, long straw.

1100
01:08:53,136 --> 01:08:54,661
Thank you.

1101
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:04,243
So you don't wanna know
what happened?

1102
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:27,060
Put it, put it. Cut it.

1103
01:09:29,773 --> 01:09:31,536
I know what happened.

1104
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:43,175
Don't go in there.
Mumbles.

1105
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,545
Mace him.

1106
01:09:46,055 --> 01:09:47,386
Hollandaise?

1107
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:49,252
I see you ordered already.

1108
01:09:49,426 --> 01:09:50,893
You were late.

1109
01:09:51,462 --> 01:09:52,860
The bastard's gonna hit me.

1110
01:09:53,764 --> 01:09:55,628
Mace him, Mumbles.
What?

1111
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:57,231
Not me, you idiot.
What?

1112
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,925
I can't move my..
- What?

1113
01:10:10,314 --> 01:10:12,338
This way, this way, this way.

1114
01:10:17,988 --> 01:10:19,979
Shouldn't you have taken precautions?

1115
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,091
Precautions?

1116
01:10:35,738 --> 01:10:37,672
Did you see that?
What happened?

1117
01:10:37,841 --> 01:10:39,239
God.

1118
01:10:40,144 --> 01:10:42,237
Well, it's your job, isn't it?

1119
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:58,557
What are these guys made of?

1120
01:11:00,497 --> 01:11:01,793
I didn't realize.

1121
01:11:01,965 --> 01:11:03,829
Realize?

1122
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:05,764
You didn't realize that they had guns?

1123
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:10,132
Big, long, dangerous machine guns.

1124
01:11:11,007 --> 01:11:13,168
With war criminals
attached to the trigger.

1125
01:11:16,246 --> 01:11:17,270
Please, stay down.

1126
01:11:20,283 --> 01:11:21,944
Just fuck off.

1127
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:44,396
Get out of the fucking way now.

1128
01:11:50,747 --> 01:11:52,145
You know what, darling?

1129
01:11:52,315 --> 01:11:56,685
I'm just gonna leave this laundry bag here
under the table for you, okay?

1130
01:12:00,923 --> 01:12:02,618
Fucking hell.

1131
01:12:06,729 --> 01:12:08,390
Shit.

1132
01:12:09,332 --> 01:12:10,595
Hold up.

1133
01:12:12,603 --> 01:12:14,194
Oh, my..

1134
01:12:20,676 --> 01:12:22,042
Oh, fucking hell.

1135
01:12:28,851 --> 01:12:30,251
Abandon ship.

1136
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,113
Run for your lives.

1137
01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:33,905
Come on. Come on.

1138
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,921
Come back with my bike,
you dirty bastard.

1139
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,122
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1140
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:31,095
You're way too dangerous for me.

1141
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:38,966
- Did I overdo it with the limp?
- No, the limp was good.

1142
01:15:39,141 --> 01:15:41,006
She's a wild one.

1143
01:15:41,177 --> 01:15:43,442
She likes you, boy-o.

1144
01:15:43,814 --> 01:15:45,542
Rather her than you, Bob.

1145
01:15:59,895 --> 01:16:01,796
I don't care if he is fucking busy, Archy.

1146
01:16:01,965 --> 01:16:04,399
If we call, he answers. That's the deal.

1147
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:05,728
Oh, there he is.

1148
01:16:05,902 --> 01:16:08,234
Oi, Councillor.

1149
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:10,195
Councillor.

1150
01:16:10,372 --> 01:16:11,430
I'll see you at lunch.

1151
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:13,974
Something wrong with your telephone?

1152
01:16:14,144 --> 01:16:16,168
Oh, I'm sorry. Shouldn't I be here?

1153
01:16:16,345 --> 01:16:20,009
I go wherever I fucking like
because this is my town, not yours..

1154
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:24,949
no matter what you and your pen-pushing
immigrant boy scouts might think.

1155
01:16:25,889 --> 01:16:27,880
So, what's going on?

1156
01:16:28,057 --> 01:16:29,719
Step in here.

1157
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:33,125
I can't do it.

1158
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:36,787
You've left it too long. You want
something the city has a ruling against.

1159
01:16:36,966 --> 01:16:38,797
They wouldn't give permission to build.

1160
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,663
Don't give me that shit.

1161
01:16:40,837 --> 01:16:42,963
I look out my window,
I see 20 buildings..

1162
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,868
this city said they'd never build.

1163
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:48,636
How did that happen? The termites got
together for a building party, did they?

1164
01:16:49,011 --> 01:16:52,072
No, sunshine.
It was backhanders putting them up.

1165
01:16:52,248 --> 01:16:53,511
Backhanders like mine.

1166
01:16:54,216 --> 01:16:57,310
Lenny's good for the money,
Councillor. He always has been.

1167
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,114
- So don't go getting cold feet.
- I can't do it this time.

1168
01:17:00,289 --> 01:17:02,349
It's not fucking Zaire, Lenny.

1169
01:17:02,525 --> 01:17:03,787
Get off my bollocks, Lenny.

1170
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:08,020
Don't you ever swear at me,
you yellow puddle of immigrant piss..

1171
01:17:08,198 --> 01:17:10,291
or I'll drown you in it.

1172
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:12,698
You feel that, do you, Councillor?

1173
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,899
You don't think there's a paper trail
for all those gifts?

1174
01:17:16,072 --> 01:17:20,634
The cars, the holidays,
the tennis courts, the swimming pools.

1175
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,836
I own these bollocks.

1176
01:17:23,012 --> 01:17:27,676
And right now, they're more fragile
than a pair of quail's eggs.

1177
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,318
Now, get it done.

1178
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:45,996
Pedro?

1179
01:17:47,636 --> 01:17:49,399
Come back here.

1180
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,443
Where do you think you're going
with that painting?

1181
01:17:56,179 --> 01:17:59,841
You never said it was your dad's,
or whatever you wanna call him.

1182
01:18:00,015 --> 01:18:01,483
You've gotta give it back, John.

1183
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:04,676
People are looking for it, bad people.

1184
01:18:05,287 --> 01:18:08,121
The streets are alive
with the sound of pain.

1185
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:12,283
You may have a point, Pete,
but I can't give it up.

1186
01:18:12,462 --> 01:18:14,395
- You know why?
- No. Why?

1187
01:18:15,497 --> 01:18:17,090
Meet me in the pub in two minutes.

1188
01:18:17,934 --> 01:18:19,925
I'll have that painting
in a couple of days.

1189
01:18:20,103 --> 01:18:22,229
- You can trust me on that.
Good.

1190
01:18:22,605 --> 01:18:25,166
That's nice. I love a clear fairway.

1191
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:27,070
That's a bit of me. That is..

1192
01:18:27,243 --> 01:18:29,439
So you like it out here, Lenny, don't you?

1193
01:18:29,613 --> 01:18:31,877
Oh, yeah.
You can't beat the great outdoors, Uri.

1194
01:18:32,047 --> 01:18:34,015
But I don't understand it.

1195
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:35,480
There's no one here.

1196
01:18:35,652 --> 01:18:38,746
That's because I have had the course
cleared for us.

1197
01:18:38,921 --> 01:18:41,117
We are not going to be disturbed.

1198
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:48,753
Victor, please, come to join us.

1199
01:18:56,171 --> 01:19:00,006
You see that pack of Virginia killing
sticks on the end of the piano?

1200
01:19:02,078 --> 01:19:03,238
Yes.

1201
01:19:03,412 --> 01:19:07,405
All you need to know about life
is retained within those four walls.

1202
01:19:09,853 --> 01:19:12,082
<i>What are we going to do, Lenny?</i>

1203
01:19:12,756 --> 01:19:16,157
Every time I am about
to make my payment..

1204
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,262
something dishonest happens.

1205
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:24,166
You wouldn't know anything, would you?

1206
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:26,551
You will notice that one
of your personalities

1207
01:19:26,564 --> 01:19:28,793
is seduced by the
illusions of grandeur.

1208
01:19:28,971 --> 01:19:32,408
A gold packet of king size
with a regal insignia.

1209
01:19:32,574 --> 01:19:35,738
An attractive implication
toward glamour and wealth.

1210
01:19:35,912 --> 01:19:40,405
A subtle suggestion that cigarettes
are indeed your royal and loyal friends.

1211
01:19:40,582 --> 01:19:42,516
<i>And that, Pete, is a lie.</i>

1212
01:19:42,685 --> 01:19:45,279
Excuse me?
Are you trying to say something?

1213
01:19:45,755 --> 01:19:47,551
I'm not trying.

1214
01:19:48,224 --> 01:19:50,283
I am saying something.

1215
01:19:54,064 --> 01:19:56,185
Your other personality
is trying to draw your

1216
01:19:56,198 --> 01:19:58,329
attention to the flip
side of the discussion.

1217
01:19:58,501 --> 01:20:01,298
Written in boring, bold,
black and white, is the statement..

1218
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:06,430
that these neat little soldiers of
death, are, in fact, trying to kill you.

1219
01:20:06,609 --> 01:20:09,475
And that, Pete, is the truth.

1220
01:20:10,447 --> 01:20:14,076
I think you forget who you're talking to,
you insolent bastard.

1221
01:20:16,152 --> 01:20:19,052
I think you forget where you are,
you fucking immigrant.

1222
01:20:20,724 --> 01:20:23,613
Oh, beauty is a beguiling
call to death and

1223
01:20:23,626 --> 01:20:26,525
I'm addicted to the sweet
pitch of its siren.

1224
01:20:26,695 --> 01:20:29,859
This is my land. It's my fucking show.

1225
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,523
I run this town.

1226
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,225
Ah! Fuck!

1227
01:20:33,403 --> 01:20:35,734
Ah! God! Ah!

1228
01:20:46,315 --> 01:20:49,581
<i>That that starts sweet ends bitter.</i>

1229
01:20:49,752 --> 01:20:52,346
And that which starts bitter ends sweet.

1230
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,358
I have to go now, Lenny.

1231
01:20:55,524 --> 01:20:58,961
I am having lunch
with the Councillor, your councilor.

1232
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:01,761
<i>This, as you know, is the ninth hole.</i>

1233
01:21:02,297 --> 01:21:05,289
And it's a long crawl back to your car.

1234
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:12,029
You should make it by sunrise,
just in time to bring me my lucky picture.

1235
01:21:12,475 --> 01:21:14,601
<i>I want it back.</i>

1236
01:21:14,778 --> 01:21:16,609
Do you hear me?

1237
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:21,140
- Yes, yes, oh, God.
Times change.

1238
01:21:22,018 --> 01:21:23,609
Goodbye, Lenny.

1239
01:21:26,288 --> 01:21:30,725
That is why you and I love the drugs..

1240
01:21:30,894 --> 01:21:35,557
and that is also why
I cannot give that painting back.

1241
01:21:43,105 --> 01:21:46,404
Now, please, pass me a light.

1242
01:21:48,377 --> 01:21:52,246
Oh, you are something special,
Mr. Johnny Quid.

1243
01:21:56,853 --> 01:21:58,844
Fucking junkies. You're fucking useless.

1244
01:21:59,021 --> 01:22:00,579
I don't want your sort in here.

1245
01:22:00,756 --> 01:22:02,189
Get up out of here. Fuck off.

1246
01:22:02,358 --> 01:22:04,326
- Go piss off out the door.
Get off.

1247
01:22:04,493 --> 01:22:06,519
- Go on, fuck off.
I'll buy this place.

1248
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,824
Fuck off, you junkie.

1249
01:22:08,997 --> 01:22:11,796
- You won't be able to catch me, fat boy.
- Stay out and fuck off.

1250
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:13,291
Ooh.

1251
01:22:15,371 --> 01:22:16,962
Is that you, Bertie?

1252
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,108
<i>What's happening about that drink?</i>

1253
01:22:19,742 --> 01:22:21,606
What's happening about that paperwork?

1254
01:22:22,244 --> 01:22:25,805
Well, I'm busy tonight,
but Monday looks good.

1255
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,617
I'll leave the papers
at my reception under your name.

1256
01:22:28,784 --> 01:22:30,149
<i>Text you the address.</i>

1257
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:35,256
Well, I'll pop around in a jiffy,
and I'll see you on Monday.

1258
01:22:40,363 --> 01:22:42,627
You are scary good at that.

1259
01:22:42,798 --> 01:22:46,256
- Do you miss it?
- Shut up, Bob, or I'll slap you.

1260
01:22:46,435 --> 01:22:49,632
All right, let's go pick up the paperwork
from your boyfriend.

1261
01:22:49,805 --> 01:22:52,137
And drop me off on the way, huh?

1262
01:22:52,876 --> 01:22:55,537
I'm going back to bed.

1263
01:22:55,979 --> 01:22:57,605
Can I come?

1264
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:06,048
- Moron, what do you think you're doing?
- What, John?

1265
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:08,417
Letting creatures in my yard
without my consent.

1266
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:14,220
John, they're good stuff.
Scotch and Cockney.

1267
01:23:14,631 --> 01:23:16,860
Like the drink and the sparrow.

1268
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:20,524
I am Malcolm, and this is my friend
and colleague Paul.

1269
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:24,563
You know, like the Christian saint.

1270
01:23:25,207 --> 01:23:29,837
Paul doesn't say much.
He's too busy thinking deep thoughts.

1271
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:34,082
Come on, John. We know you.

1272
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,012
We're big fans.

1273
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:41,055
You're what they call a real RocknRolla.

1274
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:46,457
Out, on your way.
Bon voyage and fuck off.

1275
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,765
What is this, a sit-down?
A fucking demo?

1276
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:57,771
This is a demonstration,
a demonstration of peace.

1277
01:23:58,307 --> 01:24:01,105
Where the fuck did you find
these two junkies?

1278
01:24:01,277 --> 01:24:05,110
Conference, kazi, now.

1279
01:24:11,988 --> 01:24:14,547
That's the last time
I'm having you take the piss, Pete.

1280
01:24:14,724 --> 01:24:17,386
Next time, you're on your own.

1281
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,925
I'm sorry.

1282
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:22,087
I just thought that you might've liked
a bit of company.

1283
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:24,563
I'm dead, Pete. What does that tell you?

1284
01:24:24,734 --> 01:24:28,430
It tells you that dead people
don't like company.

1285
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:32,234
- Now, jog them on.
- All right, I'll tell them to leave.

1286
01:24:32,408 --> 01:24:36,242
Yes, you fucking well will.
Smelly junkies.

1287
01:24:36,412 --> 01:24:38,243
Meeting adjourned.

1288
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:43,975
You've scared them off, sing-along.

1289
01:24:44,153 --> 01:24:46,951
But with a welcome like that,
it's not all that shocking.

1290
01:24:47,122 --> 01:24:49,591
Lucky you're not following them, Pete.

1291
01:24:53,195 --> 01:24:54,823
Pete, where's the painting?

1292
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,931
Good shot. Good shot.

1293
01:25:00,936 --> 01:25:02,198
It's the werewolf brothers.

1294
01:25:02,372 --> 01:25:04,636
What you got for us today, boys?
Anything good?

1295
01:25:05,307 --> 01:25:08,037
Paul, please exhibit to the audience
the fine artifact.

1296
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,247
Gentlemen, we are entering the realm..

1297
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:21,322
of the ancient art form
of paint on canvas.

1298
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:22,617
I'll have it. How much?

1299
01:25:23,926 --> 01:25:26,860
One moment, sir. There's a pitch
which comes with this painting.

1300
01:25:27,029 --> 01:25:29,623
I don't want the pitch.
I said I'll have it.

1301
01:25:30,733 --> 01:25:33,462
It's a very rare
and expensive painting, sir.

1302
01:25:33,636 --> 01:25:35,331
Is it?

1303
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:38,430
There you go, boys.
Have a week in the snow.

1304
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:42,368
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
It's been a pleasure.

1305
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:44,569
Come on, me man. Hey.

1306
01:25:49,085 --> 01:25:51,519
Tank, what is it? I'm in a bit of a rush.

1307
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,451
<i>You owe me, Arch.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

1308
01:25:53,622 --> 01:25:57,354
First, I found your painting. Now I found
out who's been taking Lenny's money.

1309
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:58,551
<i>Mr. Darcy.</i>

1310
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:01,829
Well, don't fuck about. Who is it?

1311
01:26:17,313 --> 01:26:20,873
"Let myself in. Thought your lady
might like the painting."

1312
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:23,849
"Love, Cookie."

1313
01:26:28,157 --> 01:26:30,523
- Hello?
- It's me.

1314
01:26:31,027 --> 01:26:33,894
- Who's me?
- Me.

1315
01:26:34,396 --> 01:26:35,625
<i>Ah.</i>

1316
01:26:36,099 --> 01:26:37,725
Well, what do you want?

1317
01:26:38,467 --> 01:26:39,867
You.

1318
01:26:40,703 --> 01:26:41,930
<i>Oh.</i>

1319
01:26:42,805 --> 01:26:44,670
Well, you better come in, then.

1320
01:27:09,465 --> 01:27:11,659
<i>- Yup?
We found out about our informer.</i>

1321
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:13,664
<i>I've got it in my hand right now.</i>

1322
01:27:13,836 --> 01:27:18,000
The informer, the one who's responsible
for all the time we've been seeing.

1323
01:27:18,173 --> 01:27:21,974
- All of them, including mine.
- Well, who is it, then?

1324
01:27:24,913 --> 01:27:27,109
Who the fuck is Sidney Shaw?

1325
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:30,819
No, Sidney Shaw
is a pseudonym, you idiot.

1326
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,152
<i>They never use their real name.</i>

1327
01:27:33,322 --> 01:27:36,416
Look, get around here
and let me have a look, okay?

1328
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:37,957
<i>All right.</i>

1329
01:27:41,363 --> 01:27:43,764
Where did he learn
a word like pseudonym?

1330
01:27:46,368 --> 01:27:48,269
Look at you, huh? Good as new.

1331
01:27:50,372 --> 01:27:52,203
I have to go now.

1332
01:27:52,908 --> 01:27:57,140
So you fancy sharing some dancing lessons
with me later on in the week?

1333
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,405
A bit of the old salsa?

1334
01:28:01,384 --> 01:28:03,476
I'll take you up on that.

1335
01:28:04,386 --> 01:28:07,082
- Oh, I have something for you.
- Uh-huh.

1336
01:28:07,256 --> 01:28:10,918
Thought you might like it because
I know how much you like paintings and all.

1337
01:28:17,065 --> 01:28:18,761
So you like it?

1338
01:28:20,235 --> 01:28:23,466
You've got very good taste,
Mr. One Two.

1339
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:27,739
Oh..

1340
01:28:29,712 --> 01:28:32,908
- What's happened, Len?
- Well, they broke my leg in four places.

1341
01:28:33,082 --> 01:28:34,912
Didn't you hear?

1342
01:28:35,784 --> 01:28:38,685
That bastard's made me limp
for the rest of my days.

1343
01:28:39,322 --> 01:28:41,256
What do you want me to do?

1344
01:28:42,524 --> 01:28:46,324
Well, I need that painting, Arch.

1345
01:28:46,496 --> 01:28:50,226
- I need it real bad.
- I'll get that for you, don't you worry.

1346
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:53,162
- I think I can do better than that.
- What?

1347
01:28:53,336 --> 01:28:56,668
Someone has been at the Russian's money.
Couple of silly gunslingers.

1348
01:28:56,838 --> 01:29:00,137
- Well, who?
- You know them.

1349
01:29:00,475 --> 01:29:03,740
- You don't like them either.
- I'm not playing fucking games here, Arch.

1350
01:29:03,912 --> 01:29:05,380
Who is it?

1351
01:29:07,115 --> 01:29:08,673
Mumbles, Bob and One Two.

1352
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:19,747
So why did you call, Johnny?
Sorry, Johnny's not here.

1353
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:21,912
But the pipe is.

1354
01:30:22,091 --> 01:30:25,492
And the pipe says
Johnny heard you were in trouble, boys.

1355
01:30:25,661 --> 01:30:28,891
Whoever we're talking to, will you
please relay the message to Johnny?

1356
01:30:29,064 --> 01:30:34,195
Tell him that his dad, his jack-in-the-box-
surprise, gangster daddy, paid us a visit.

1357
01:30:34,636 --> 01:30:36,127
Shut down a few of our venues.

1358
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:40,935
Intends to shut down a few more
unless Mr. Quid puts in an appearance.

1359
01:30:43,412 --> 01:30:47,177
Why are you talking to the pipe, Roman?
You're madder than I am.

1360
01:30:48,184 --> 01:30:50,811
Come back, Johnny. Come back home.

1361
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:56,019
Now, Johnny will come quietly..

1362
01:30:56,192 --> 01:31:00,855
but you may have a couple of problems
with the pipe.

1363
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,354
Buy us both a cup of tea.

1364
01:31:03,966 --> 01:31:06,992
No need for any noise,
we'll let Pete sleep on.

1365
01:32:29,284 --> 01:32:31,014
Is this a bad time, One Two?

1366
01:32:36,524 --> 01:32:38,925
I mean, we can always
come back a bit later.

1367
01:32:44,966 --> 01:32:48,368
You wanna take the stairs
or the elevator, Mr. Cole?

1368
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:50,801
Bandy, come here.

1369
01:32:56,444 --> 01:32:59,345
- You been drinking?
- No, Mr. Cole.

1370
01:33:01,182 --> 01:33:05,118
Think before you drink,
before you drive me mad.

1371
01:33:08,823 --> 01:33:10,689
<i>Hello, Len, it's me.
Archy.</i>

1372
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:13,453
I've got the boys
wrapping up One Two in a carpet now.

1373
01:33:13,628 --> 01:33:14,720
<i>Get over here.</i>

1374
01:33:14,896 --> 01:33:16,956
<i>- Yeah, I'll be around in a little bit.
- Good.</i>

1375
01:33:20,869 --> 01:33:22,427
Hold on.

1376
01:33:26,942 --> 01:33:29,774
- Who's there?
- One Two, it's us.

1377
01:33:29,944 --> 01:33:31,572
Come up.

1378
01:33:33,548 --> 01:33:36,039
And it looks like
I'll be bringing the others and all.

1379
01:33:36,217 --> 01:33:38,743
Not too bright this lot, are they?
Hold on.

1380
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:42,913
Look, I gotta go, got another call.
Fucking hell, it's all go on this job.

1381
01:33:43,091 --> 01:33:46,390
- Hello?
- Archy, we got your boy.

1382
01:33:46,561 --> 01:33:48,324
What's left of him.

1383
01:33:48,497 --> 01:33:51,261
You might wanna hose him down.
He smells like a rotten goat.

1384
01:33:54,136 --> 01:33:55,659
Uri.

1385
01:34:11,953 --> 01:34:13,887
<i>Da, Uri, I'm sorry.</i>

1386
01:34:14,055 --> 01:34:17,149
- But I still don't like it.
- I don't care what you like, Victor.

1387
01:34:17,326 --> 01:34:19,658
I'm in charge. Now, wait here.

1388
01:34:19,828 --> 01:34:22,992
Your last girl cost us 20 million.
One before, even more.

1389
01:34:23,164 --> 01:34:25,689
God knows how much
this one will cost us.

1390
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:27,768
Victor, you're so cheap.

1391
01:34:33,676 --> 01:34:35,439
Can I come in?

1392
01:34:36,478 --> 01:34:40,846
Sorry to surprise you,
but I have something for you.

1393
01:34:42,685 --> 01:34:44,118
A token of my appreciation.

1394
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,948
What's this for?

1395
01:34:47,389 --> 01:34:51,826
Please do not be insulted
but you have come to mean a lot to me..

1396
01:34:51,993 --> 01:34:55,157
and I value much more
than just your service.

1397
01:34:55,331 --> 01:34:57,798
This is simply just a reflection
of my appreciation.

1398
01:34:59,702 --> 01:35:02,728
I would like to ask you
something personal.

1399
01:35:09,545 --> 01:35:11,069
Would you marry me?

1400
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:16,609
Well, I think I might need
a couple of days.

1401
01:35:19,555 --> 01:35:21,351
Just to think about it.

1402
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,448
Well, sure. Of course.

1403
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,153
Sorry.

1404
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:31,521
Not now, Victor, I'm busy.

1405
01:35:35,237 --> 01:35:37,329
A very nice painting.

1406
01:35:38,707 --> 01:35:40,503
How long have you had it?

1407
01:35:41,109 --> 01:35:43,600
Years. Do you like it?

1408
01:35:46,148 --> 01:35:50,448
Beauty's a cruel mistress, is it not?

1409
01:35:54,256 --> 01:35:57,817
Victor, please come to join us.

1410
01:36:05,634 --> 01:36:08,228
Hello, Arch.

1411
01:36:08,503 --> 01:36:11,131
Shrouded and tied, just like the old days.

1412
01:36:11,306 --> 01:36:13,604
What is it today? The rack?

1413
01:36:13,775 --> 01:36:17,734
The garrote? Or is it the old
drowning-in-crayfish trick?

1414
01:36:17,912 --> 01:36:20,506
You're still full of hot air, Johnny.

1415
01:36:22,184 --> 01:36:24,208
You're looking a bit down.

1416
01:36:24,386 --> 01:36:27,287
Has that old clown
been working you long hours?

1417
01:36:27,456 --> 01:36:30,823
You always were loyal.
There's no dog like a loyal dog.

1418
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:34,127
- Watch your mouth, John.
- Look at him, boys.

1419
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:37,121
Scary, ain't he?

1420
01:36:37,298 --> 01:36:39,789
Well, that's what four years inside
does to a man.

1421
01:36:39,969 --> 01:36:42,028
It eats away at his soul..

1422
01:36:42,203 --> 01:36:46,573
and when it's all gone,
it makes a man quite scary.

1423
01:36:47,743 --> 01:36:52,737
You ever wonder how you got in there?
What grass informed on you?

1424
01:37:03,559 --> 01:37:05,423
Hello, Archy.

1425
01:37:06,228 --> 01:37:08,457
Hey, Johnny boy. Look at you.

1426
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:11,827
Look at this, Dave.
Don't you look the part.

1427
01:37:12,001 --> 01:37:15,731
Show us your guns, Uncle Arch.
I told the boys all about it.

1428
01:37:15,904 --> 01:37:18,838
Don't be cheeky. Get in the car.

1429
01:37:21,109 --> 01:37:22,304
Give us your money.

1430
01:37:22,478 --> 01:37:25,072
Give us that, in the car.

1431
01:37:34,256 --> 01:37:35,746
Be good boys..

1432
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:39,422
because you never know
who's watching.

1433
01:37:46,301 --> 01:37:49,202
So who we got in there, then?
Anyone I know?

1434
01:37:50,471 --> 01:37:51,734
Anyone famous?

1435
01:37:57,845 --> 01:37:59,939
Handsome Bob.

1436
01:38:01,382 --> 01:38:04,318
Mumbles, One Two.

1437
01:38:05,887 --> 01:38:09,654
I bet you could operate
a nice gas shower.

1438
01:38:09,824 --> 01:38:12,520
I could see you
with a couple of S's on your collar.

1439
01:38:12,694 --> 01:38:17,596
- Stiff goose in your step.
- Shut it, or you will get hurt.

1440
01:38:18,132 --> 01:38:21,125
That, Roman and Mickey,
is the famous Archy slap.

1441
01:38:23,005 --> 01:38:24,869
You shut it.

1442
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:29,067
Or I'll do you myself,
you poisonous little toad.

1443
01:38:29,444 --> 01:38:33,381
Don't hurt me, Arch. I'm only little.

1444
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:36,079
Get out.

1445
01:38:37,252 --> 01:38:40,118
- Roll them out.
- Daddy.

1446
01:38:41,323 --> 01:38:43,722
Nice wheels.

1447
01:38:45,594 --> 01:38:47,323
Sorry about the painting.

1448
01:38:47,496 --> 01:38:50,590
I needed the cash
for a bit of the old dusty show biz.

1449
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,224
So it's gone now.

1450
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,198
Lost to the world
of degenerate, stoned no-hopers.

1451
01:38:55,369 --> 01:38:57,860
Never to be seen again
by the eye of a clean soul.

1452
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:04,712
What are you, boy, if you are not poison?

1453
01:39:08,117 --> 01:39:11,347
Your dad couldn't even bear
to look at you.

1454
01:39:11,787 --> 01:39:14,721
So no wonder he fucked off
and left me to pick up the pieces.

1455
01:39:15,556 --> 01:39:17,922
But that wasn't enough for you.

1456
01:39:18,092 --> 01:39:21,153
You had to push your mom
into a bottle of pills..

1457
01:39:21,329 --> 01:39:23,194
and a house full of nutters.

1458
01:39:23,364 --> 01:39:28,427
And all she got there
was a hot bath and a cold razor.

1459
01:39:29,003 --> 01:39:30,528
Why?

1460
01:39:32,006 --> 01:39:35,373
Because you're poison, John, that's why.

1461
01:39:37,845 --> 01:39:39,313
What can I say?

1462
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,644
I'm a junkie, crackhead, no-gooder.

1463
01:39:42,818 --> 01:39:45,615
You should never have wasted
your money on that school.

1464
01:39:45,787 --> 01:39:47,083
Archy, get him out of here.

1465
01:39:48,623 --> 01:39:50,454
I've had enough of him.

1466
01:39:50,626 --> 01:39:53,390
I don't trust myself. Use someone else.

1467
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:58,323
It's a gathering. I love a gathering.

1468
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:02,162
Look. It's Mumbles, One Two.

1469
01:40:02,804 --> 01:40:07,036
Handsome Bob, all the old faces today.

1470
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:10,269
And it was all going so well.

1471
01:40:11,012 --> 01:40:12,502
Except for Archy.

1472
01:40:14,182 --> 01:40:15,411
Had to ruin the day.

1473
01:40:18,287 --> 01:40:20,380
I was gonna tell him
a story about you, Daddy.

1474
01:40:21,756 --> 01:40:24,692
I thought I'd tell him the story
about how you grassed him up.

1475
01:40:24,859 --> 01:40:26,953
Whoa, fuck!

1476
01:40:27,128 --> 01:40:31,588
Fucking hell, Len. Calm down.

1477
01:40:31,867 --> 01:40:33,027
Now, give us that.

1478
01:40:33,969 --> 01:40:36,436
That wasn't one of your best shots,
was it now, Daddy?

1479
01:40:37,206 --> 01:40:39,697
If you wanted to shut me up,
it should've been higher.

1480
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:42,207
- Danny, come here.
You're only 6 feet away.

1481
01:40:42,377 --> 01:40:43,639
Come here.

1482
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,945
You get rid of him, Danny,
you understand?

1483
01:40:49,117 --> 01:40:51,311
Get rid of him.

1484
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:59,452
You don't know
how much trouble you've caused..

1485
01:40:59,627 --> 01:41:04,155
but please understand
that I will kill you very slowly..

1486
01:41:04,332 --> 01:41:07,131
if you don't tell me where my..

1487
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:08,826
Hey, Archy.

1488
01:41:10,404 --> 01:41:11,804
The address is in my jacket.

1489
01:41:11,974 --> 01:41:14,408
I wouldn't mess you around, Archy,
it's in my jacket.

1490
01:41:23,085 --> 01:41:24,847
What does it say?

1491
01:41:34,328 --> 01:41:36,627
You want to know what it says, Len?

1492
01:41:39,234 --> 01:41:44,501
Funny thing about the law,
it can be quite flexible.

1493
01:41:45,274 --> 01:41:47,503
Because every time an informer..

1494
01:41:47,676 --> 01:41:51,475
finds himself in front of a judge,
a secret letter..

1495
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:55,640
stands witness
as to the cooperation and efficiency..

1496
01:41:55,817 --> 01:41:57,181
<i>of that informer.</i>

1497
01:41:57,351 --> 01:42:00,787
And if that informer
provides adequate information..

1498
01:42:00,956 --> 01:42:05,654
then that dog of dogs
is magically released.

1499
01:42:05,827 --> 01:42:08,454
A sort of get-out-of-jail-free card.

1500
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:10,359
And it comes with a very good alibi.

1501
01:42:11,265 --> 01:42:14,099
Now, you give us the names
of the people you want put down..

1502
01:42:14,269 --> 01:42:16,168
and we'll get them the long sentences.

1503
01:42:16,337 --> 01:42:19,204
You can appear to reduce those terms
through your contacts.

1504
01:42:19,373 --> 01:42:23,503
We'll make you look like a fucking
guardian angel to the underworld.

1505
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:25,502
Trusted throughout.

1506
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:28,547
The only evidence
that will ever remain of this deal..

1507
01:42:28,716 --> 01:42:30,685
comes in the form
of a very exclusive..

1508
01:42:30,851 --> 01:42:33,685
and hard-to-come-by legal document
called a secret dept.

1509
01:42:33,854 --> 01:42:37,722
As in deposition or handlers sheet.

1510
01:42:38,827 --> 01:42:41,091
Of course, the informer
always uses a false name.

1511
01:42:41,262 --> 01:42:42,695
What name do you like?

1512
01:42:42,863 --> 01:42:44,161
- Johnny?
- Tommy?

1513
01:42:44,332 --> 01:42:46,823
You can have
Elvis fucking Presley if you fancy.

1514
01:42:47,002 --> 01:42:49,868
But I've seen this name
many times over the last 20 years.

1515
01:42:50,505 --> 01:42:51,698
<i>And I always wondered..</i>

1516
01:42:51,872 --> 01:42:54,864
Who is this Sidney Shaw, Len?

1517
01:42:55,777 --> 01:42:57,038
Nothing to do with you.

1518
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:59,737
What name do you like the sound of?
I like Sidney.

1519
01:43:00,282 --> 01:43:01,613
I like the sound of that.

1520
01:43:01,783 --> 01:43:04,774
Sidney Shaw. Sounds a bit like an actor.

1521
01:43:04,953 --> 01:43:07,386
You're free to go, Mr. Sidney Shaw.

1522
01:43:07,555 --> 01:43:09,353
No, they're setting me up, Archy.

1523
01:43:11,193 --> 01:43:15,128
You are a very dirty bastard, Sidney.

1524
01:43:16,198 --> 01:43:18,427
You are a very dirty bastard indeed.

1525
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:22,398
Cut that lot free,
get them out of here now.

1526
01:43:22,671 --> 01:43:24,935
No need to worry just yet, fellas.

1527
01:43:25,106 --> 01:43:28,076
Nothing's gonna happen
while we're standing in the lift.

1528
01:43:28,476 --> 01:43:31,070
They'd have to carry
the corpses over to the cars..

1529
01:43:31,246 --> 01:43:33,475
and that's too much like hard work.

1530
01:43:33,981 --> 01:43:37,917
<i>In about two minutes from now,
when we're all walking along happily..</i>

1531
01:43:38,086 --> 01:43:41,783
Danny boy over there is gonna turn
and pop me two in the head.

1532
01:43:44,725 --> 01:43:47,126
Then one in the throat just to be sure.

1533
01:43:48,729 --> 01:43:50,993
You shouldn't have
brought me here, fellas.

1534
01:43:51,166 --> 01:43:52,997
<i>You're just gonna end up as witnesses.</i>

1535
01:43:54,935 --> 01:43:57,234
Once they've "dealt" with us..

1536
01:43:58,439 --> 01:44:01,341
they're gonna put our corpses
in the boot of a stolen car..

1537
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:04,502
<i>and pour 6 gallons of petrol on top.</i>

1538
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:07,613
I can let your imagination
fill in the rest.

1539
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:12,453
But see now, Danny boy is rattled.

1540
01:44:13,788 --> 01:44:15,346
Because he knows that you know.

1541
01:44:15,524 --> 01:44:19,654
So he's gonna fire.

1542
01:44:38,412 --> 01:44:41,439
Mickey, pass me the gun.

1543
01:44:41,615 --> 01:44:44,448
Quickly. Quickly, Mickey.

1544
01:44:44,618 --> 01:44:47,884
Don't worry, he can't defend himself,
he's got no head.

1545
01:45:00,167 --> 01:45:01,828
May I please have some help, fellas?

1546
01:45:07,274 --> 01:45:08,673
Put your fucking hands up.

1547
01:45:18,752 --> 01:45:21,381
I think we should get out of here,
don't you, John?

1548
01:45:30,332 --> 01:45:32,265
Make the deal, come on.

1549
01:45:32,434 --> 01:45:35,961
Turn them in. It's not like
the first time you done it, is it?

1550
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:41,667
Michael Finny, 10 years.

1551
01:45:42,978 --> 01:45:44,377
Fred the Head.
- Fred the Head.

1552
01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:47,105
<i>Give him a five,
for a bank job he's about to pull.</i>

1553
01:45:47,282 --> 01:45:49,773
Here's the time and here's the place.

1554
01:45:49,951 --> 01:45:51,918
Frazier Nash, 15 years.

1555
01:45:52,087 --> 01:45:55,078
<i>One Two, just a two-stretch
to calm the flash fucker down.</i>

1556
01:45:55,957 --> 01:45:59,586
Cousin Ronnie got six years
because of you, you bastard.

1557
01:45:59,761 --> 01:46:02,286
<i>Mumbles thinks he's a clever boy,
so give him a three.</i>

1558
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:05,396
Byron Dexter, eight years.

1559
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:08,057
The Jew twins, 14 years.

1560
01:46:09,604 --> 01:46:12,936
The Jew twins, 14 years.

1561
01:46:13,108 --> 01:46:18,636
Archy, he's as loyal as a dog,
but he's getting a bit greedy. Four years.

1562
01:46:19,247 --> 01:46:20,440
<i>Four years for Archy.</i>

1563
01:46:21,716 --> 01:46:26,380
And of course me, Archy,
four long fucking years.

1564
01:46:37,832 --> 01:46:41,791
<i>There is no spring without a winter.</i>

1565
01:46:42,069 --> 01:46:44,663
<i>No life without death.</i>

1566
01:46:45,006 --> 01:46:47,270
<i>And the demise of Lenny
has blown a new season..</i>

1567
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:50,104
<i>into the lungs of young Johnny.</i>

1568
01:46:52,413 --> 01:46:56,350
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Sidney Shaw.</i>

1569
01:46:59,154 --> 01:47:03,021
Well, it looks like that clinic
sorted you right out, Johnny boy.

1570
01:47:06,694 --> 01:47:07,820
You feeling better?

1571
01:47:08,997 --> 01:47:12,091
Well, I was. Until I saw youse twos.

1572
01:47:12,934 --> 01:47:16,631
I'm clean now. Straight, I gave it all up.

1573
01:47:16,805 --> 01:47:18,203
All but these little bastards.

1574
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,673
Come on, give us a cuddle.

1575
01:47:23,578 --> 01:47:25,341
Welcome home.

1576
01:47:26,747 --> 01:47:30,046
- Give us your money, Arch.
- No, I can do better than that.

1577
01:47:30,217 --> 01:47:33,618
Turbo, show him
his welcome-home present.

1578
01:47:33,787 --> 01:47:36,188
What, you got me another coffin?

1579
01:47:38,792 --> 01:47:41,023
Goodbye, cruel world.

1580
01:47:43,797 --> 01:47:47,666
Now, I know how much you like the art, I
thought that would look good on your wall.

1581
01:47:48,069 --> 01:47:50,970
Someone's been telling you stories, Arch.

1582
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:53,136
Now, that must've been expensive.

1583
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,842
As it happens, it did cost
a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg.

1584
01:48:00,247 --> 01:48:02,341
I see your music's back in the charts.

1585
01:48:02,516 --> 01:48:04,417
Well, that was when I was a RocknRolla.

1586
01:48:04,586 --> 01:48:06,144
Why, what you gonna be now, John?

1587
01:48:07,454 --> 01:48:09,422
You wanna watch out..

1588
01:48:10,692 --> 01:48:13,024
because I'm gonna be
just like you, uncle.

1589
01:48:13,194 --> 01:48:17,688
Now I'm gonna be a real RocknRolla.

1590
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
