9
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,500
I thought that I should tell you.

10
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,300
I prefer "Wild Cat".

11
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,300
Your photograph  doenst do you a least of justice

12
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,400
I´m nervous as hell.

13
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600

- Let me take this.

14
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,600

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,700
Let´s have a drink.

16
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,300
Have a seat, "Wild Cat".

17
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,800
   - This is a very nice place
- I do enjoy the privacy.

18
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,000
And you live here alone?

19
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
You´ll love this wine.

20
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,500
I think I´ll need something stronger.

21
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
To eternity.

22
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
To eternity.

23
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,900
So where´d you tell your
husband and you were going?

24
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,600
My husband?

25
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,000
Weddingring is never quite gone.

26
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
I am sorry.

27
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,500
I didnt mean to...

28
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
I am just very nervous.

29
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Does it make the difference?

30
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,200
Not to me.

31
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Is this your first time?

32
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,600
- Yes.
- I doubt it very much.

33
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,000
- Is that so?
- Did you enjoy your first time?

34
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,100
Dont tell me, that you can read minds.

35
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,900
Who was she?

36
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
Cristal Williams.

39
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
She must´ve been something.

40
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,300
I was in college.

41
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
College.

42
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,800
I havent done it since.

43
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,400
But you never forgetted the feeling.

44
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,700
No.

45
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,300
Allow me.

46
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,400

48
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,300

Car has been here for two nights,

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,500
Parking patrol called and had it towed.

58
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,800
Punched in the platenumbers, so here we are.

59

- No they didnt!
- They did.

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,500
I need to ask you some guestions
about a woman, you´ve been talkin to -

140
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,400
The seat is taken.

141
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Who is she?

142
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,100
I dont know you and
 I certainly didnt call you.

143
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,400
I hope you have a good reason
for imposing.

144
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,400
This woman, that you´ve been 
talking to in internet -

145
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,000
When was the last time
 that you saw her?

146
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Has anything happened to her?

147
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,900
- She disappeared.
- She propably runaway from her husband.

148
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
That is my wife.

149
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,400
So why dont you cut out your smart-ass replies
and just answer the question.

150
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,000
You are questing this house, detective.

151
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,900
I could ask you to leave.

152
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,100
And I could ask you to 
join me downtown.

153
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,100
stay up till 2am, drinking
 really shitty coffee.

154
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,400
You could watch me type of my report, 
or you could just answer the question -


155
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,500
have you seen the woman in the picture?

156
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,700
-Yes
- When?

157
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,200
- Mayby four days ago.
She came in -

158
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,100
stayed awhile.
And left.

159
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,800
And what was she here for?

160
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,700
You are the detective, impress me.

161
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,000
What was she here for?

162
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,400
She wanted to have sex 
with another woman.

163
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,800
No worry, detective.

164
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,100
its not an entitment
on your abilities.

165
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,100
I´m sure you are 
very capable man.

166
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,200
Did you have sex with my wife?

167
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,500
If she wanted you to know, I´m sure 
she would have told you

168
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,300
Dont fuck with me.

169
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,700
Did you have sex with my wife?

170
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,500
I doubt very much that information
is going to help you find her.


171
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,300
You know what?
Fuck it.

172
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,800
I´m gonna be seeing you real soon.

173
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,300
Detective!

174
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,200
I hope you find your wife.

175
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,100
I´d love to see her again.

176
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,300
- To wife off a cop.
- I didnt know.

177
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,500
- You know, what this means?
- You boofed with her.

178
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,800
- I warned you to be careful.
- Why do you care?

179
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,400
They are just human.
They cant do nothing to you.

180
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,400
I´ll never be haunted down again.

181
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,800
The estate is owned by private british 
trust for 200 years. Well, you dont see much of that anymore.

182
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Residence has been rebuild 1947.
And it was sold five years ago.

183
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,900
- To who?
- I dont have those records.

184
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,800
- Actually, noone is listed as living in that address.
- Is that all you got?

185
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,700
- I could get you the name of notar,
who managed the affairs of trust.

186
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,400
- Brenda, you are so good to me.
- My pleasure.

187
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,700
The trust was constituted for the single
purpose in mind.

188
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,600
To manage the properties that used 
to belong to Batory family.

189
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
 Batory family?

190
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,300
Ancient Polish royalty.

191
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,100
This particular estate was sold
for one dollar, I handled the transaction myself.

192
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,800
Sounds like a helluva deal.

193
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,500
Used to be a simple way 
avoiding heritage taxes.

194
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,300
So who heritaged the place?

195
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,900
I´m affraid my duties bind me
the confidentiality.

196
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,800
Your duties?

197
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,800
I´m pretty sure, mister Renaud -

198
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,700
that I can have a search warrant and
forteen cops inside an hour.

199
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,600
And I can promise you -

200
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,300
that I will dig up every scrap of paper you
ever bothered to write a phone number.

201
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,500
We both know, that would 
be highly illegal.

202
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,300
Yeah, it propably would be.

203
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,400
C´mon, your an intelligent man,  
succesfull business -

204
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,300
beautifull office. 
You´ve got lot of high profile clients.

205
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,600
I dont think they´d appreciate that kind of circus,
that I´m gonna bring to you.

206
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,500
Who owns the place?

207
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,500
Dont worry.
I´m not gonna tell anyone.

208
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,300
Elizabeth Kane.

209
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,300
Elizabeth Kane.

210
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,300
- What do you know about her?
- Nothing.

211
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,000
I received precise instructions, 
she showed out of the blue.


212
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,100
- She doesnt ever bother, who live there.
- She does now.

213
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,300
Elizabeth is back?

214
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,400
- Yes?
- I´m here to see Elizabeth Kane.

215
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,800
- She´s not here.
- Where is she?

216
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,800
Hello?

217
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Who was that?

218
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,600
Um, noone, some kids.
You can go back to sleep now.

219
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,600
Irina -

220
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,000
It was that cop.

221
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,000
He knows your name.

222
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,500
- Evening
- Come on in.

223
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,100
- Cognac? 
- Yeah.

224
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,900
Had the car dusted for prints.
Only two sets -

225
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,700
yours and hers.
- What about her picture?

226
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,300
Showed it to all security guard, janitor
and all the office buildings in the area.


227
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,100
Noone remember seing her.

228
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,900
- Chips, anyone? 
- Thought you were only getting ice.

229
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,700
Thought I´d throw in 
some steaks and stuff.

230
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,600
Hey, my dad got that for 
us from Indonesia.

231
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,700
Hey Nancy.

232
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,100
I´m glad you came.
Any news on Jessice?

233
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,700
- Nothing.
- She´ll show up, I´m sure of it.

234
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,600
- Are you out of your mind?
- Main event just started -

235
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
12 rounds to go.
He aint going anywhere.

236
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,200
C´mon, not in this house.
It´s not cool, Nancy.

237
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,800
I love my husband.

238
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,500
That´s right.

239
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,000
And we both know, how 
much you love your wife.

240
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,600
That´s right.
I love my wife.

241
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,000
We just do things for each
other, which they dont do.

242
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
That´s right.

243
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,800
Dont stop.

244
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,300
What are you doing?

245
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,200
That is what makes us so good -

246
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,900
all this love -

247
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
That´s good.

248
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,100
Do it faster.

249
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,700
Fuck, he is gonna love that.

250
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,500
This wont take long.

251
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,400
Nice wheels

252
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,400
Wanna go for a ride?

253
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,900
I cancelled my last appointment.
I´ll be there in 20 minutes.

254
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,400
Yeah.

255
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,700
It will not be the same thing
we will have something special this night.

256
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,200
Bye.

257
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,500
I was thinking -

258
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,100
Who else knows my 
name in this town?

259
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,800
- Couldnt come up with anyone else.
- He threatened to have my office searched.

260
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,500
That is one scary threat.

261
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,100
Your lovely daughter.

262
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,100
Is she still a virgin?

263
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,600
I cant have police here.
Your bank accounts -

264
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,600
You are in deep convenient -

265
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,400
That is why you are still alive.

266
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,600
But there are many things that
 I value more than money.

267
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,100
Your daughter is not one of them.

268
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,500


269
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,400
Do I know you?

270
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,700
This is something -

271
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,400
Did Ray put you up to this?

272
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,700
In a bizarre sort of way.

273
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,700
This is fresh.

274
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,200
You can come out now Ray.

275
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
She is cute.

276
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,200
Come here.

277
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,800
I can see how he 
would take a liking to you .

278
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,500
Your head is filled with 
many strange things -

279
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,200
screaming, to get out.

280
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,100
Where is he?

281
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,100
Is he watching?


282
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,700
Would you like that?

283
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,000
I dont know.

284
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,300
Ray is gonna own me,
bigtime.

285
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,600
You are special one.

286
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,500
I will remember you.

287
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,000
Am I invited for the dinner?

288
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,000
You are fucking trespassing
again!

289
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,100
-- Call the cops.
-- She is not here!

290
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,200
-- He is here.
-- I should kill you.

291
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,000
-- I am going to have to take some measures.
-- I apologize.

292
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,200
I am sure you
can understand my situation.

293
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,400
Perfectly.

294
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,500
Your wife had an affair, discovered
the whole new world of possibilities -

295
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,700
and left you. I dont think its
that difficult to grasp.

296
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
You were the last person
that has seen her.

297
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,800
And I will treasure that memory
forever.

298
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,300
-- Some wine?
-- What the hell.

299
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,300
Who is the woman on the portrait?

300
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,300
That's why you are here?
To talk about art?

301
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,500
I´m taking polite fucking interest, okay?
Humor me.

302
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,100
If you thought we´d be standing here, waiting for you
without anything better to do -

303
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,800
I´m sorry to shatter your vision.

304
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,200
What do you need to know?

305
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,400
I want to know if my wife
said that she would see you again.

306
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,200
She said that she was looking forward to it.

307
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,500
Any specific date?

308
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,500
I didnt say  that
i wanted to see her again.

309
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,100
Okay, miss
Elizabeth Kane.

310
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,900
I´ve serious reason to believe
that my wife did not runaway.

311
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,100
As far as I´m concern, you were
last person seen with her.

312
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,000
Which is enough for me to go get your 
fucking warrant for this fucking mansion.

313
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,400
You can give a damn if 
your wife is dead or alive.

314
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,100
What is dragging you off the wall is the fact 
that she couldnt stand you and she left you -

315
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,000
And she might be having
a time of his life with somebody else.

316
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,500
Let it go, detective. I am sure that
you will find ways to enjoy -

317
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,100
your newly found freedom.

318
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,600
Have a good
night, little buddy.

319
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,700
I have done 
something terrible to you.

320
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,400
I´m sorry.

321
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,900
I have decided to bring back
 your wife.

322
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,500
-- Dad, I am going to be late.
-- Allright.

323
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,500
- You left the patio-door open again
- No I didnt.

324
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,800
Hello Lisa.
Car´s looking good.

325
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,900
-- What happened last night?
-- Who is your friend?

326
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,400
-- Connie.
-- Hello, Connie.

327
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,400
-- Is this your detective friend?
-- I hope you havent being saying bad things about me.

328
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,100
Nice wheels. Is this 
replica or the real thing?

329
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,400
C´mon.

330
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
So, where were you
last night at 3:00 AM?

331
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,900
I was sucking pillow.

332
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,000
No, you were driving your car.

333
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,700
-- No, I was in bed like from 11 a.m..
-- No, I saw you drive by.

334
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,600
-- That must have been someone else.
-- How many times have I fixed your car?

335
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,900
-- I think that I would know when I saw it.
-- Why would I lie to you?

336
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,400
You think that I could get a ride
sometime?

337
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,300
Yes?

338
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,100
No, I wasnt
feeling very well.

339
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Yes, what the fuck
is the urgency?

340
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,400
Hello? Hello?

341
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
-- Has  your wife come back yet?
-- Not yet.

342
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,500
Have you talk
with Erszebet yet?

343
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,100
-- Dont you have stuff to do?
-- Yes.

344
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,600
- Go do it!
- Okay!

345
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,700
Tiny.

346
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,000
-- Remember Angy Manning from homicide?
-- No, not really.

347
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,500
How did your mess with infernal affairs go?

348
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:00,200
Well, well. I bought ´59 Corvette
to celebrate, thank you for asking.

349
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,200
Have a seat, Ray.

350
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,500
-- We need your help with something.
-- What is going on, captain?

351
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,200
Your partners wifes body was 
found early this morning.

352
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,700
Multiple stapwounds.

353
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,300
Nancy Cusack is dead?

354
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,600
Her body was dumped near highway  15.

355
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,100
Someone reported seen someone
to take a large plasticbag -

356
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,000
out of the trunk of the car -

357
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,300
and going to the woods
-- We have the description of the man.

358
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,300
And the licenseplate number.

359
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,400
Did you make an arrest?

360
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,700
Goods needs a permission to
search your new Corvette.

361
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,000
-- What?
-- It would save me a lot of paperwork.

362
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,800
What the fuck is it this?

363
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,300
Ray, where were you last night
about 2:00 AM?

364
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,900
Not dumping my partners wife in the fucking
woods, if that is  what you are asking!

365
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,400
-- Who made that call?
-- A concerned woman.

366
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,300
Aint that just dandy.

367
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,800
Look, you know as well as I do, 
only two people could have made that phonecall.

368
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,600
The one who saw it
or the one who did it.

369
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,200
You could help me to eliminate one of 
those two real fast -

370
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,000
just tell me where
 were you last night.

371
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,800
I was fucking sleeping, 
it was 2:00 AM, asshole.

372
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,400
Well, was there anybody ...that could confirm that?
At least for part of the evening.

373
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,700
Yes, two mistresses.

374
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,600
Yeah, tuesday is a treesome-night,
we like to go-out whole fucking night.

375
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,600
I was sleeping alone.

376
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,500
Captain, this is ridiculous. We´ve
known each other for how long?

377
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,200
Ok, that is enough for now.

378
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,100
Angie, you mind
giving us a minute?

379
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,500
Of course, captain.

380
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,300
15 years. Yes...

381
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,300
I´ve  known you for 15 years.

382
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,000
And I´ve known the Cusacks wife
 close to five.

383
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,500
You have to find 
whoever made that call.

384
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,900
There is a nice little hotel in old Montreal -
ideal for little escapes.

385
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,200
I recommended it to you,
 you remember?

386
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,900
What you do on your own time and 
who you do it with, is non of my business.

387
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,800
Even when I saw you come out the room with
 Nancy Cusack -

388
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,800
I kept my mouth shut.

389
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,600
But I ... I hope
 you broke it up.

390
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:43,800
You know.. your wife disappearing,
dead-found mistress -

391
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,400
-- I have seen worse shit.
-- Captain, I did not kill her.

392
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,900
I know, I´m  with you Ray,
but Angy wants a DNA sample.

393
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,600
Fuck Angy and his DNA!
Fuck it!

394
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,500
Please, do it for me.

395
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,300
Nancy scratched to
her aggressor.

396
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,800
The forensic  found
skin samples her fingernails.

397
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,800
So?

398
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,500
I´m so sorry, Dean.

399
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,100
-- Fuck. What are you doing?
-- I should shoot you right now.

400
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,600
Put the fucking gun away! For fucks sake you
gonna get yourself in shit!

401
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,700
Dean, I didn´t kill her.
I swear to God, I didn´t kill her.

402
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,800
Did you have fun fucking my wife?

403
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,600
I didn´t kill her.

404
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,200
You think that I could 
do that to her?

405
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,300
Piece of shit.
I trusted you!

406
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,000
Are you going to do it?
you are going to do it!?

407
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,400
I´m going to blow your fucking brains out.

408
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,000
Do it,  do it!

409
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,200
-- Ray, Ray!  Nathan...
-- Daddy!

410
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,200
How could you?

411
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,800
I need to talk to you!

412
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:49,000
I want you to go back to chat rooms, I want
you to ensure we´ll have young blood.

413
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,800
Young, beautifull, innocent blood.

414
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,000
When will I get to bite?

415
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,400
-- When you are ready.
-- You´ve been saying that for two years!

416
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,300
I´m ready now!

417
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,900
I´ll decide when you are. Two years  is nothing
compared to eternity ahead of you.

418
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:14,400
-- But why dont you let me  kill girls?
-- It´s not about killing.

419
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,200
It is about seducing
your prey.

420
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,800
She must watch you -

421
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,100
desire you -

422
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,600
You cannot take unwilling
soul.

423
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,900
And the blood
must be pure.

424
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,200
Fine.

425
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,100
Tell me about
your first time.

426
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,200
I dont know what you think
you´re doing.

427
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,400
-- I´m helping Ray to find his wife.
-- Why?

428
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,600
Now he is totally available,
I think you should invite him over -

429
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,200
get him drunk and
see what happens.

430
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,900
C´mon, you are so
into the guy.

431
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,500
If you are worried, I could
give you some pointers.

432
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,000
Thanks.

433
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,500
-- She wrote back
-- Answer her.

434
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,600
My friend told me that you would be a fun
person to meet.

435
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,600
What do you do?

436
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,100
Okay.

437
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,300
Like she´s going to call.

438
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,900
Hello. 

439
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,100
-- Firebird?
- Erszebet? 

440
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,000
-- You wanted to talk?
-- Yes, how is it going?

441
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,400
-- How old are you?
-- 21.

442
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,000
So .. what did you
your friend tell about me?

443
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,600
She said that
we would get along.

444
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,200
What is your friends name?

445
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,300
- Why, does it matter?
-- Can I call you back?

446
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,300
-- Yeah, but hang on lit...
-- I call you back.

447
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,100
She is not going to call.

448
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,800
She´ll call.

449
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,300
-- You want some water?
-- No, I´m okay.

450
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,300
-- Hello.
-- Hey honey.

451
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,200
-- Hey mom.
- How is the house?

452
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,800
-- House? Fine, me too.
-- Great.

453
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,400
Look, we wont be back tomorrow, your
dad wants to stay one more day.

454
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,900
-- Ok, that´s fine.
- You still have food?

455
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,900
-- Food?
-- Yes, food.

456
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,500
-- No. I´ll probably be dead when you get back.
-- Joker. 

457
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Good, I´m on public phone
only wanted to tell you.

458
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,800
-- Okay.
-- Good night.

459
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,000
Good night mom.

460
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,500
-- Yes?
-- I said that I´d call you back.

461
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,200
-- Erszebet?
-- May I come in?

462
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,100
-- How did you get my address?
-- I thought we might have a drink.

463
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,200
No. My parents are uppstaris. I didnt 
ask you here. You have to go.

464
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,100
-- After the drink.
-- No.

465
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,200
Connie?

466
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,000
Look what you made
me to do.

467
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,900
It could have been
so much nicer.

468
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:01,400
Liz? You know what album thing is
that goes in this one?

469
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:09,100
Fuck, Liz,
what did you spill?

470
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Evening, Raymond.

471
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,800
Vanessa, come and sit down here baby

472
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:55,000
I haven´t seen you awhile. You have been
staying out of trouble?

473
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,000
I always get myself out of trouble,
you know that.

474
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,200
-- You look a little bit down.
-- No, life is good.

475
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,200
A one big bed
of colorful roses.

476
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,100
You would like to go back and
share some of that happiness?

477
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,300
-- I´ve got one room for spare.
-- Oh, yes, that sounds good.

478
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,800
Told you that you´d find
ways to enjoy yourself.

479
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,700
-- What are your doing here?
-- We seem to share same taste.

480
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,300
Clubs, women.

481
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,500
-- You following me?
-- I came to see a good friend.

482
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,700
And here you are.
Isn´t it something?

483
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,100
I´m coming after you.

484
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,900
When you catch your bone,
you just dont let it go, detective?.

485
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,600
I admire that in a man.

486
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,000
If you feel the need to
talk, I´ll be backstage.

487
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,900
Try not to topple anything on
your way.

488
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,600
Step inside, detective.

489
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:14,700
My friend has been under a lot of pressure.
I need some time alone with him.

490
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,400
I have seen you here before.

491
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,200
I know that you´ve seen me.


492
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:57,600
Any issue standing between us.
 It´s a time to clear it up.

493
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Well, just write it down
and sign it?

494
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,400
Your wife came to see me
looking for something she was missing.

495
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,700
Unfortunately
for her, she lied to me.

496
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,400
I dont touch married women, detective.

497
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,900
-- Neither should you.
-- What happened?

498
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,400
Nothing happened.

499
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:29,800
Your wife was a charming woman. We spoke,
I shared my thoughts. She understood.

500
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,500
We had a drink, she left.
No hard feelings.

501
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,000
Your wife didnt
cheat on you.

502
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,300
At least, not with me.

503
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:45,800
And why didnt you just...
tell me that before.

504
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,800
There is something passionate about you
when you get upset.

505
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,200
I enjoy seeing that.

506
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,300
I dont know why.

507
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,300
So now what?

508
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,100
There is nothing else.

509
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
I´ll be leaving soon. 

510
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,000
You will never have to
see me again.

511
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,400
Where are you going?

512
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:14,000
Sometimes its good to return to meaningful 
places in your life.

513
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,100
As a  sort of balcrament.

514
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,200
A therapy for the soul.

515
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,900
You must have places like that.

516
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,300
Bongiorno, inspector Thurzo.

517
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,200
Interpol. Roma´s station. 


518
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,000
May I speak with you?

519
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,600
I have an informant on board
of cruise ship " The Batore ".

520
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,700
This informant
has been instructed -

521
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,600
to tell me each time a certain
passenger boards the ship.

522
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,600
This certain passenger
 is a woman.

523
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,600
One month age she
disembark here in Montreal.

524
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,200
And you went to
visit her to her house.

525
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:03,700
-- Is she wanted?
-- No, under investigation.

526
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,200
-- For what?
-- Possible murder.

527
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,800
Possible murder?

528
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,100
What is that?
An Italian crime?

529
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,300
We have no victims.
Only missing women.

530
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,500
Arent you little out of your jurisdiction?

531
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,600
I take some time off.

532
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:24,200
You see, I´ve personal interest in this case
my granddaughter went missing 6 years ago.

533
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,200
You have been following this
woman for 6 years?

534
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,500
On and off.

535
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,400
But I came here to warn you. This is
unusually dangerous woman.

536
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,900
You must only approach her in
 strictly professional manner.

537
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,900
Keep your distance.

538
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,900
And let your own people
 do the work.

539
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,000
-- The way you you do it?
-- Precisely.

540
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,100
I know what I´m talking about.

541
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:49,200
-- You, you could end up dead.
-- What is that supposed to mean?

542
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,900
It means that I have
a plane to catch.

543
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,300
If there is something that I should
know, mayby you should tell me.

544
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,500
Pope, Pope.
It is a curious name.

545
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:04,900
Arrivederci, detective Pope.

546
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,800
Yes, they pulled her out of the water
about 15 minutes ago.

547
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:16,400
She´s not even 16 years old.

548
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
No, I handle it from here.

549
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,200
We are going to need
a rape-kit.

550
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:37,400
Oh Jesus, Pope.
She was your babysitter.

551
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,700
She was just a kid.

552
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,600
I´m going to ask you something.

553
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,100
I want you to think
real hard about it -

554
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,700
because ... I´d really love to hear 
your answer.

555
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,200
Now mayby ... mayby
we could explain -

556
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,700
Nancy Cusack´s prints and
the blood all over your car.

557
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,300
And mayby, allthou
it might be difficult -

558
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,500
we could explain
your skin -

559
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,800
under the nails of
your partners wife.

560
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,400
Now, help me out on here, ´cos
 I really would like to help you.

561
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,900
Is there any way possible? I mean
any way possible -

562
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:29,900
that you could explain, how
your semen got out of your dick -

563
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,300
and into your
babysitters body?

564
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,200
besides the obvious.

565
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,200
Relax. I´ll be right back.

566
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,500
What is it, captain?

567
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,400
The bites on the girls throat -

568
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:12,100
Forensics says its neither human
nor animal. Sounds familiar?

569
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:20,100
Looks like we got a another riddle
for you to solve, you sick fuck.

570
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,400
Elizabeth!

571
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,100
Here, I brought you the results
 so you could see yourself.

572
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,700
-- Is there a match?
-- Yeah, you.

573
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,300
-- Who else?
-- That´s it. Just you.

574
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,800
It´s fucking impossible!
She handed me the glass!

575
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,100
Well, she´s neither a ghost or
she had her fingerprints removed. 

576
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,400
What is going on here?

577
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,300
-- I have to get out of here.
-- Pope, listen to me, you have a kid.

578
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,900
Whatever you got yourself into,
you gotta get yourself out, now.

579
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,900
-- I gotta go.
-- Pope,  what you mean go, go where?

580
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,400
Pope?

581
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,700


582
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,800


583
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,500


584
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,200


585
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,600
Shut the fuck up! Do not move!

586
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,300
Your client was not in
the castle. Where is she?

587
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,800
-- She is not my client.
-- You handled her affairs!

588
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,000
I handled one transaction,
for God's sake.

589
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,300
I´ve got sixth sense, 
when someone is lying to me.


590
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,900
You have no idea the evil
 you are dealing with.

591
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,700
You wanna see evil?

592
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,400
I´m gonna show you evil.

593
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,900
She´ll take my daughter.

594
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,000
Fuck!

595
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,200
Looks like we got
the same problem, Renaud.

596
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,900
I can get rid of it
... allright?

597
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,400
I make it all go away.

598
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,600
C´mon.

599
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:17,400
Venice. She has
a place in Venice.

600
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,600
Excuse me.

601
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,200
You know where this is?

602
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,200
-- Why?
-- I have a friend -

603
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,700
Excuse me.

604
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,300
Excuse me.

605
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,900
Fuck!

606
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:57,000
That is enough.
Get out of here.

607
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,900
-- Excuse me. Do you speak English?
-- Why should I?

608
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,500
I saw this book of yours
in the window.

609
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,000
A man with fine taste in
woman, there it is

610
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,500
-- What is the story of this one?
-- Elizabeth Bathory. Countess Drácula.

611
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:33,200
Why do you ask? Usually those interested
in this book arent interested in history.

612
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,700
I saw this portrait
in someones house.

613
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:39,000
-- A copy, ofcourse
-- I do not know. I guess so.

614
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,200
Why do you call it
Countess Drácula?

615
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,700
Countess Bathory, was one
of the cornerstones -

616
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,200
of the modern vampyre mythology.


617
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,400
-- I never hearded the novel.
-- What novel?

618
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,500
Dear sir,  she was
as real as you and I.

619
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,700
And one of the most evil
human being that ever lived.

620
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,700
Care for a a biscuit,
italian specialty.

621
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,000
Thank you.

622
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:11,100
She was born in 1560, off
true Hungarian nobility -

623
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,000
renounced as one of the most
 beautiful women of her age -

624
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:20,000
And sadist of unparallel savagery.

625
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:29,000
From her early age, the lady took pleasure
in torturing and killing her servingmaids.

626
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,700
Dismembering them and even
freezing them alive.

627
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,100
One day, on her usual fits of rage-

628
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:44,800
she slapped one of the maids so hard, that some
 of the poor girls blood-

629
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:49,000
spilled out and splattered
on the countesses hand.

630
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,300
At which point, on her eyes, a miracle has occurred.

631
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:56,300
Then there ... on the spot,
where the blood had stained -

632
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,500
the skin appeared
to rejuvenated itself -

633
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,900
the wrinkles,
they seemed to disappear.

634
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,300
Of course, after that, there were
no limits for madames lunacy.

635
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:16,500
Over the years, some 650 young women
were maimed and brutalized -

636
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,500
simply to satisfy her thirst of blood.

637
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,500
She would drink it,
she would bath in it!

638
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,300
In dellusional quest
for eternal youth.

639
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,200
Thats some fucking story.


640
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,100
I often wandered, if woman like that
could live today.

641
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:40,000
You know, some people
think that she never died.

642
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,800
Someone people believe in
Loch Ness monster.

643
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,800
Do you sell any of these?

644
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500


645
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,000
Yes, I have an invitation.
Its here in somewhere.

646
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,900
Nice outfit.

647
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,600
This is a very exclusive party.

648
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,100
This is where all
the fun begins.

649
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,200
Good. Yeah.

650
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,100
Oh, by the way, there is
a strict dress code.

651
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,000
No exceptions.

652
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,500
You´ll love this wine.

653
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,200
Come.

654
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,100
Buena sera.

655
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:09,600
-- Oh sorry, I dont speak Italian.
-- Isnt that a relief?

656
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,600
-- Enjoying yourself?
-- Yes I am.

657
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
-- What is the occasion?
-- You dont know?

658
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,100
No, I came with a friend.
He didnt tell me much.

659
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,600
-- He didnt?
-- No.

660
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:31,200
I´ve had my share of sneaking
into parties myself.

661
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,500
You busted me.

662
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,200
Where is the owner?

663
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,600
The proprietress?

664
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,200
I´m affraid she died ,
my dear boy.

665
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,800
around 400 years ago.

666
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:47,100
Do you trust me?

667
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,500
Sweet girl.

668
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,800
Open.

669
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,200
Is it too tight?

670
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,100
Now...

671
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:33,200
Countess Elizabeth
Bathory of Hungary.

672
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,500
-- Are you shitting me?
-- Do you know her?

673
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,700
This house is hers?

674
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,900
One of many.

675
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,400
The original palace was
demolished a long time ago.

676
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:46,400
This was built on
whatever ruins were left.

677
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,400
What about the present owner?

678
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:53,700
Very few people have actually met our hostess.
She never stays around long enough.

679
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,400
Elizabeth Kane
is current houstess -

680
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,900
with very selected circle of friends.

681
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:07,900
Look at all these women. Batory herself
 would´ve been exstatic.

682
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,900
-- I assume that you are alone.
-- Yeah, you know, i better go get my friend.

683
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,100
Excuse me.

684
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,900
You have done well tonight,
Irina. All is forgiven.

685
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:18,400
I thank you for your beauty.

686
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,800
-- Did you miss me?
-- Oh boy, detective-

687
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:46,100
Elizabeth gonna be
really uppset.

688
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,000
And better not let
her see you.

689
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,800
Oh, God -

690
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,100
What did you do?

691
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,600
Get away from her.
Get away from her!

692
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,500
It could kill each of them before
you could limb halfway cross this room.

693
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,900
-- Fuck you could!
-- I will make this quick.

694
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,200
You have no idea how much
I loved that dog.

695
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,300
Try to stay awake, detective.

696
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,600
I would´t want you to miss what happens next,
for anything in the world.

697
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,500
What am I going to do with you?

698
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,300
If you werent a decent familyman, one
might think you´re enjoying all this pain.

699
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,400
Enjoying the blood.

700
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:15,100
You look well.
I am glad.

701
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,900
I dont feel so well, after I bounced  in that car
for 5 hours.

702
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,700
You will be fine.

703
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,900
What kind of fucked up jail is this?

704
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,100
You must not swear
in this place.

705
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,200
There is a monk.
Formaly a great psychiatrist.

706
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:51,700
Who has helped us many times in 
the past on most extraordinary cases.

707
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:56,600
You might not agree
with some of his methods.

708
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,400
But I can assure you,
he is quite effective.

709
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,500
-- A monk?
-- Yes.

710
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:09,000
I dont think that this has been
reported to proper authorities.

711
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,600
I can assure you that it has.

712
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:13,700
What is your story?
What are you?

713
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,300
Interpol?
Vatican intelligence?

714
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:20,800
I want to thank you for coming to Venice
as a fugitive of the law.

715
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:26,300
It allowed me to follow you. Also allowed
me to get search warrant to go inside the house.


716
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:32,700
to have you arrested. Otherwise, I had no
legitimate motives to go inside.

717
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,700
So how come I´m not arrested?

718
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,700
But you did not do anything,
 we both knew that.

719
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:40,500
And I have good
news for you.

720
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,100
You  think you killed the girl, but you did not.
It was a dog.


721
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:47,400
No, no, no. I killed the dog also. But
I left the girl dead in the hallway.

722
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,600
- No, no, no girl.
-- What do you mean, no girl?

723
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:54,100
What about Elizabeth?
I threw a knife right thru her back.

724
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:58,700
I wish you had, but
you were not in condition to throw anything.

725
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:06,900
You hit her with the handle of the knife, 
she has a small scar in the back of the neck.

726
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,100
Allright, listen, inspector
Thurzo, Father Thurzo -

727
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,900
whatever the fuck
your story is.

728
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,400
I want to know what is
going on with that woman.

729
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:25,100
There are many things you dont
understand about our prisoner.

730
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,200
But you asked me to see her and I allow it
because she asked to see you.

731
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:34,200
But if you swear one more time 
in this place -

732
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:39,100
I make you walk all the way 
back to Venice right now.

733
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:41,300
I want to see the prisoner.

734
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,100
Show him.

735
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:57,700
-- What are they doing?
-- They pray for her soul -

736
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:01,500
and the souls of the dead.
And you have 10 minutes.

737
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,200
Inspector Pope!

738
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,600
Do me one favor.

739
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:12,600
Do not accept anything she gives you.

740
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,000
Nice of you to travel all the way here.

741
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:43,900
Care for a glass of wine?

742
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,200
Why dont I place the glass here.

743
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,400
And I´ll go sit over here.

744
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,600
Feel safer?

745
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,500
Two girls
died in your house.

746
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:12,600
One is in critical condition.
We managed to save other four.

747
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,900
That...
really upsets you.

748
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,200
How long has this been going on?

749
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:20,200
For quite some time now.

750
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,500
Is my wife dead?

751
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:28,000
You should not have killed my dog.
I was very fond of  her.

752
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,300
But your wife is not dead.

753
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:36,500
She is very much alive inside
of me, like all the others.

754
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,400
How many have there been?

755
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,500
Why dont you step right up and ask
me what you truly came here to learn?

756
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:52,500
-- Who are you?
-- There.

757
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,000
Have some wine.

758
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,800
No.

759
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,000
Be polite.

760
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,600
Carefull.

761
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,300
To eternity.

762
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,800
I should have warned you.
Its not quite your taste.

763
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:39,900
-- Who gave that?
-- Settle down detective, nobody that you met.

764
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,900
I got it from the hospital.
They have to take care of me.

765
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,700
To have this
condition.

766
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,800
Who are you?

767
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,900
In three days, they will transfer me to one
small clinic on the Swiss border.

768
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,200
They will take me by truck 
on mountain roads.

769
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,100
It will be a long ride. 
Anything can go wrong.

770
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,900
They will never expect anyone
to intervene.

771
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:17,100
They will dissect me.

772
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,800
Your 10 minutes is up!

773
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,400
Detective -

774
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:32,800
people have done far stranger things
because of love.
