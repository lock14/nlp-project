3
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,900
Ringo...

4
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:44,000
They're looking for you. It's
the end of the world for you.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
What's that sound?

6
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,800
Thats the sound of the
Gion Shoja temple bells.

7
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,100
What?

8
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,400
You know, them
Heike and Genji boys?

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,200
On a distant island, these two clans
split into the Reds and the Whites.

10
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,700
To wage a war...

11
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Sorta like that a "War of the
Roses," you know? In England...

12
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,000
Who won?

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,000
The Whites?

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,400
This high noon battle,
was waged in Dannoura.

15
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,900
Near the Heike Clan and Red...

16
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,000
Got themselves hog-tied by
the Genji Clan and White...

17
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,300
Their story, it goes a
little something like this...

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,900
The sound of the Gion
Shoja temple bells,

19
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,500
echoes the impermanence
of all things.

20
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
What bells you say?

21
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:20,000
The color of the sala flowers reveals
the truth that, "to flourish is to fall. "

22
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
You okay fella?

23
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,900
The proud do not endure,
like a passing dream.

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,500
On a night in Spring.

25
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,800
The mighty fall at last...

26
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
See you in hell!

27
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,200
To be no more than
dust before the wind.

28
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,800
Ringo! That's why I love you!

29
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Presented by
komag

30
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,800
Hey! Nothing back there!

31
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
You ain't heard me?

32
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,900
It's a nothing town!

33
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,500
Bet you came for the gold too!

34
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,500
Well, there ain't none!

35
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,500
Which are you? White or Red?

36
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,200
You Genji or Heike?

37
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,500
Which of you is gonna buy it?

38
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,300
My reward's one third...

39
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,900
If there is no
treasure, no pay!

40
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,700
Benkei! Show him...

41
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
No doubt about who is
going to be left standing.

42
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,100
But best not get any ideas
about playing Yojimbo!

43
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
You gotta be alive to
defend your money...

44
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,700
Stranger!

45
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Kid's got a heart,
and balls to match.

46
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,000
No! Join us!

47
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,800
We'll do better than a
third! We'll give you half!

48
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,600
Half?

49
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
We'll give you everything.

50
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,100
But with us, its a
lifetime contract.

51
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,500
Don't know about that, I don't
stay long... in one place.

52
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,900
Suits us fine!

53
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,800
We'll give you half
for this one time deal!

54
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,600
How 'bout it?!

55
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,200
Not too shabby.

56
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,300
Hey! Boy!

57
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,100
Hey hey...

58
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,300
If you're such a quickdraw,
you don't need them!

59
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,300
Take it all, and tell them to
shove their lifetime contract.

60
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,400
Stay out of it! You old bitty!

61
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,000
Us grannies can't
help but meddle!

62
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,200
Boy, don't rush yourself!

63
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Make your choice after
cooling your heels.

64
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,000
This town can't offer you food,
but I can offer you some Soba.

65
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
At my place...

66
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,800
Come with me!

67
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,500
Hey hey hey hey!

68
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Hey!

69
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Follow him!

70
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Bah! Forget that!
Bring him here...

71
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,300
I'll teach her good.

72
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,100
So the Reds rolled
in first, eh?

73
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,700
Yeah, how'd you figure that?

74
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Simple, the Sheriff.

75
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,000
They say the law hitched
with the weakest side.

76
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,300
Must mean, they made him
an offer he couldn't refuse.

77
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,500
Of course not.

78
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,200
Maybe he's looking for
a chance to switch sides.

79
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,800
How long's it been like this?

80
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,500
Two months, since
the Heikes rolled in.

81
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,300
And before that, gold
prospectors started coming around.

82
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
(Idiotically) What're
you doing here?!

83
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
(Idiotically)
What?! What the hell?

84
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
But what they couldn't
figure out was,

85
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:22,165
why so many
people and why now?

86
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,100
At the end of last month,
a town with the same legend!

87
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:32,500
From the motherload,
the country's gone crazy!

88
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,765
Those Heike gold terrorizers!

89
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,100
Every nook and cranny of every
town with the same treasure legend,

90
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,700
is swarming with prospectors!

91
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,700
Its genuine gold rush!

92
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,100
You can't touch this
land, you'll be cursed.

93
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,600
Ha! We'll take that
curse off your hands!

94
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
No!

95
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,600
You see?! We're raised hearing
the legends all our lives!

96
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,500
And we can't fight which is why,
as you lay waste to our land!

97
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,700
In the beginning, we
expected them to be a Godsend.

98
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,200
Because they were
Heike, like us.

99
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,700
But so soon they started.

100
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,600
The Heikes ran off the
prospectors and started digging!

101
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Look!

102
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,300
Kiyomori!

103
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Boss Kiyomori! We found this!

104
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,200
Instead of that wood marker
that read, "Fear the Curse!"

105
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,500
I knew it!

106
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,500
So they figured the
treasure must be somewhere,

107
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,000
and the Heike have
been here since.

108
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
From today, you're one of us.

109
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,900
Think of it as
being on vacation.

110
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,200
Yes, I've been meaning
to take some time off.

111
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,000
Get a little sun myself.

112
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,800
Akira!

113
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,200
Stop, stop! Don't
do anything stupid!

114
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Daddy, I'm scared!

115
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Stop!

116
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Heihachi, son...

117
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,600
Men need courage
and resolution.

118
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,700
I'm scared daddy!
Let's go home!

119
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
Let's go... let's go!

120
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,300
They ransacked the resting
place of our ancestors.

121
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,700
I go and get help.

122
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,800
Daddy!

123
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,300
...daddy!

124
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Boss Kiyomori.

125
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,300
But his reign of
power didn't last long.

126
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,700
Dang, you boys are a day
late and a dollar short!

127
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,600
This is our town!

128
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Dang!

129
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,700
Genji's...

130
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,700
Shigemori, you got too
fat when you were a boy.

131
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,400
Huh?

132
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,500
Boss Yoshitsune

133
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,600
The Genji's didn't make a
move against the Heike's.

134
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,600
They left the gold
digging to them.

135
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,000
Sat back and waited for their
chance to steal the wheat.

136
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,300
Finders, keepers.

137
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,400
After that, people
began to leave.

138
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Just a few families are left.

139
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,800
On the way here, I
met a guy leaving town.

140
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
He said there wasn't any gold.

141
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Ah, we might as well hire you.

142
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,200
But all the town can
offer you is this.

143
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,700
Something.

144
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,200
Hey, try this.

145
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Hey, hey! Welcome back!

146
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
This is my grandson, Heihachi.

147
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,800
So, you boys got it yet?

148
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,200
Give it a go.

149
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,400
Death, isn't to be feared.

150
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,200
Don't watch the blade!

151
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,400
How many times do
I have to tell you?

152
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
Don't follow the blade with
your eyes! Don't see it!

153
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Feel it!

154
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,300
Thats the essence
of Mononofu training.

155
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,900
Mononofu training
ain't somewhat ancient.

156
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,900
Being a Samurai is a
philosophical way of life.

157
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,100
But the life of Mononofu
means a life of fighting!

158
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
If you ask me, Samurai are
still wearing their skippies?

159
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,100
They're vein, they're still
concerned about their looks.

160
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,400
That's tits on the
pool thinking! ^_^

161
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,100
But if you peel away that last
layer. So you... are naked.

162
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,800
This and a real
fighting spirit is,

163
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,400
Warriors luck in life.

164
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,300
This realm...

165
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,500
Our realm!

166
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,400
Is deeper than the Samurai's.

167
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,800
Now...

168
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,700
You will come at
me, or whistle dixie.

169
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,400
Why...?

170
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,200
Why were we born in
this spineless age!

171
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,500
What's it gonna be?

172
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
Take this handsome
man to the Reds,

173
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,400
or hand him over
to the Whites.

174
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,700
You know?

175
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,900
I must say...

176
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
I don't know.

177
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,100
Depends on him.

178
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,900
Today's special is the Whites, with
a side of mashed potatoes and soup!

179
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,000
Forget about the Heike gang!

180
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,300
They're boss Kiyomori smells
like a dead dog on a hot day!

181
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,400
He's lost so much
he's getting dumber.

182
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Goddamnit! Sheriff's late.

183
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,600
The sound, of the...
Gion Shoja temple bells.

184
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,700
Echoes the impermanence
of all things.

185
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,200
You follow?

186
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,600
Yes, I... uh...

187
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,500
It means, everything in
this old world changes.

188
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,000
It means we can never
call ourselves out.

189
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,600
We'll finally restore the glory of
our family name, and then ride in high.

190
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,600
The Genji gang will
be left in ruins.

191
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,400
The color of the sala
flowers reveals the truth,

192
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,800
that to flourish is to fall.

193
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,700
Thats it.

194
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,100
Its a law of nature, the
Genji's are going down!

195
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
From today...

196
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
I read this.

197
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,400
What's that?

198
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,300
Shakespeare... Henry the VI.

199
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,400
The War of the Roses.

200
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
War of the... Roses?

201
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,500
Camel boy, don't you
know your Shakespeare?

202
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,700
Its a story about the
Reds winning the war.

203
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,500
The Reds... win?

204
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,200
Yes, we'll win!

205
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,400
Yea! Kiyomori!

206
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,000
What?!

207
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,200
Kiyomori...

208
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Don't ever call
me Kiyomori again!

209
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,800
From today...

210
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,700
The name's... Henry.

211
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,100
Mwahaha!

212
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,400
Hey quit that shit!

213
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,500
Okay, you got it!

214
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,800
From today you
are Henry!... Boss.

215
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Henry! Henry!

216
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,300
Now?

217
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
Side with the Genji's!

218
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,100
They got a lady, a young
fine ass cream gravy!

219
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,500
That lady used to be a dancer!

220
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,900
She's the kid's mama,
but still mighty fine.

221
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,700
Hasn't aged a bit.

222
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,400
A woman of true Genji lineage.

223
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,000
He's Genji and Heike?

224
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,500
Huh?

225
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,100
Oh... the kid?

226
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Yeah, he's a half-breed.

227
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,100
And his father?

228
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,600
Got himself killed.

229
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,500
You of the same stock... boy?

230
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,300
F- F-F...
Fine, fine!

231
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,300
Nani?!

232
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,200
He can't talk no more.

233
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,500
How do you, after
seeing your dad murdered.

234
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,800
What's his mother
doing on the Genji side?

235
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,800
To begin with, that granny's
boy went to work in the city.

236
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,200
Then one day that
boy, her son Akira.

237
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,300
Brought a Genji woman home.

238
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,700
Mama, the days of being Genji
or Heike... are done with.

239
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,700
I don't know how or
where the two met.

240
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,400
But his mother
blessed their marriage.

241
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,400
So Red and White got hitched.

242
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,400
And they figured crossing roses,
literally with both colors... was romantic.

243
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,600
And they raised Heihachi.

244
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,300
Their Red and White treasure.

245
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,500
But then the fighting
started again.

246
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,400
Finders keepers...

247
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,100
Kiyomori!

248
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Get out!

249
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,000
There ain't no gold here!

250
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,900
That's it?

251
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,600
Take it all!

252
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,000
If you want it? Take it!

253
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,800
And get out!

254
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,300
Daddy!

255
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,400
Heihachi!

256
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Daddy!

257
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,200
Red rose...

258
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,300
My favorite color
looks good on you.

259
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,500
Folks say a Genji
woman painted Red,

260
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,800
was a flaming hymn.

261
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,500
I teach you well!

262
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
I show you!

263
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,000
A good time!

264
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,800
I know! I know!

265
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,600
So she ran to the hideout
of her own flesh and blood.

266
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,000
Was it to protect her son, or
get vengeance for her husband?

267
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,000
You too, Sheriff.

268
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,900
Sure! Don't mind if I do.

269
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,600
How much for the lady?

270
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Say what?!

271
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,400
How much you got?

272
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,200
Depends on how much
you're payin' me.

273
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,700
Keep it in your
pants, little liver.

274
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,000
The tougher man gets the girl.

275
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,400
Do what you like.

276
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,400
Do it here, or upstairs.

277
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,500
Wherever and
however you please.

278
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,900
You're the second calling wolf I
ever really wanted to draw iron at.

279
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,400
Who was the first?

280
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
A legend...

281
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,900
One I heard, when I was a kid.

282
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,800
Oh yeah?

283
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
The bloody...

284
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
Benten...

285
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,600
Bloody Benten

286
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,900
The Fighting
Goddess... legend.

287
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,500
Shit!

288
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,900
Now I really want
to draw iron at you!

289
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,800
Nice... huh?

290
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,100
Ain't fine, but it
hits you deep down.

291
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,700
The Anasazi play that music.

292
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,000
They were here
before any of us.

293
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,900
They still keep, the old ways.

294
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,200
You'll do fine.

295
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,400
I want Kiyomori dead.

296
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,000
You've sold away your
body... everything.

297
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,000
All for revenge.

298
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:32,900
So what?!

299
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,400
Don't pity me, I don't need
useless compassion from you.

300
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,500
Good, I just mumbled
something you don't understand.

301
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,300
Do you want me?

302
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,900
Yes.

303
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,400
I want you... very much.

304
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,800
But be careful, Yoshitsune's men
left town to get that powerful weapon.

305
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,500
Yoichi wants you dead.

306
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,900
They'll likely
be here by sun up.

307
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,900
When the shooting starts,

308
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,500
take Heihachi and
escape to the mountains.

309
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,800
You're not gonna run?

310
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,800
Oh, you got something
against them too?

311
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,200
I got my reasons.

312
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,700
Have the roses bloomed yet?

313
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,900
What are they named?

314
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,700
Love.

315
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,700
They're cold.

316
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:57,900
Here in my scabbard,
meditating that.

317
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,300
<i>[They are reciting lines from
Henry VI; Act 2, Scene IV]</i>

318
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,600
Shall dye your white
roses in a bloody red.

319
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,300
Here...

320
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,200
Meantime, your
cheeks do... count-

321
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,200
Counterfeit our roses, for
pale they look with fear...

322
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,700
as witnessing the
truth on our side.

323
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:42,300
No, Plantagenet, not
for fear but anger

324
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,200
that thy cheeks
blush for pure shame

325
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:57,100
to counterfeit
our roses. And yet!

326
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,200
Thy tongue will not
confess thy error.

327
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,300
That Sheriff's late!
Bring him here you idiot!

328
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,300
Somethings you
gotta see through.

329
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,500
What're you gonna do now?

330
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,900
I bet Kiyomori is going nuts.

331
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,800
Maybe he hasn't figured
out he's been betrayed yet.

332
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,700
He may be dense,
but he ain't stupid.

333
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,900
No, no no no... He
hasn't got a clue.

334
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,600
As long as we...

335
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,600
So you want go
back to their side?

336
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,900
Too late for that.

337
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,600
You said it!

338
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,400
So what do we do now?!

339
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,700
Don't get impatient.

340
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,300
He ain't going
nowhere for awhile.

341
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,800
You reckon?

342
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
You just watch.

343
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,100
At least, as long as we
stay here, we're safe.

344
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,000
We got time.

345
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,900
Why don't you take a dump?

346
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,200
And have a think?

347
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,300
Howdy Sheriff...

348
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,900
A special weapon
will be here soon.

349
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,700
Can't let the Genji's get it.

350
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,300
Tell the Heike to
obstruct their wagons,

351
00:56:37,335 --> 00:56:40,100
if you don't we'll
all be killed.

352
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,100
Sorry...

353
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,200
What are you doing boy?!

354
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,900
Shit, well get off your butt!

355
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,100
Hold your horses.

356
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,900
Instead of telling
the god awful truth,

357
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,700
don't you reckon we'd
better high tail it?

358
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,800
I ain't listening
to you no more!

359
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,300
Kiyomori!

360
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,100
Boss Kiyomori!

361
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,000
Name's Henry!

362
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,700
Where have you been?!

363
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,300
I was spying on the Genji's.

364
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,300
And things are getting
really out of hand.

365
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,900
Excuse me...

366
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,300
Come again?

367
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,300
Stupid cow!

368
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,900
I told you we should've
skipped town...

369
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,800
I told you.

370
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,400
Shit!

371
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,000
Go!

372
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,400
Fear nothing!

373
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,800
Watch it!

374
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,500
Thats dangerous!

375
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,500
Shigemori!

376
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,700
What?!

377
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,300
You did this!

378
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,500
Fire boys, he's
climbing out the window!

379
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,700
How'd he pull that off?

380
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,600
Come!

381
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,200
Ichiro, Matsui!

382
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,300
Follow me.

383
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:02,900
What happened?

384
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,800
I'll tell you later, we're
going to the old man's place!

385
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,000
Heihachi! Come on hurry!

386
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,300
This way!

387
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,200
Watch your step.

388
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,900
Take Heihachi
and go without me!

389
01:04:40,935 --> 01:04:42,017
What did you forget?!

390
01:04:42,052 --> 01:04:43,100
Something important!

391
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,600
What... who?!

392
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,700
Forget them you
don't need them!

393
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,600
No! They're...!

394
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,400
They're...

395
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:51,500
They're... my... ours!

396
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,600
No matter what, one
of you's gonna die!

397
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,500
Heihachi!

398
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,700
Please, please, please!

399
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,400
If you want them to live...

400
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,500
Drop... your... guns!

401
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,400
No more!

402
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,300
Quit your bitchin'!

403
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,900
The time is now!

404
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,500
Hey, hey!

405
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,200
Die!

406
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,200
Lucky me...

407
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,900
Henry!

408
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,700
Henry!

409
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:42,700
Shigemori... I won't
die until we win.

410
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,800
Payback's a bitch!

411
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,800
A she's the shit!

412
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,800
Before you die...

413
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,500
I have something
sweet to show you!

414
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,100
You want some bitch?

415
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,200
You animal...

416
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,200
Toshio! Throw it here!

417
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,700
Can't be...

418
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,700
Bloody... B-

419
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,800
Heihachi!

420
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,800
What are you doing?

421
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,900
Open your eyes!

422
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,100
See for yourself!

423
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,800
You can't close them!

424
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,200
Open your eyes!

425
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,400
Heihachi!

426
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,000
Heihachi! Open your eyes!

427
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,400
What were you
doing acting alone?!

428
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,900
You got balls, but no brain!

429
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,100
Ruriko, why did you
hide this from me?

430
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,100
I thought we were friends.

431
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,300
Sorry but...

432
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:49,000
Could you visit this address?
And stock up on these.

433
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,600
If he is still alive.

434
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,500
My signature here,
should help you out.

435
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,700
I wish I could go, but I
can't leave the boy alone.

436
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,300
Ruriko...

437
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,800
But these are guns?

438
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,800
Tell him, I need
help and he owes me.

439
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,400
You are the only
one I can depend on.

440
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,000
So she's still kickin' eh?

441
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,800
What's BB?

442
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:19,400
When this devily talented
goddess, used to played music...

443
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,700
she would hold her
instruments in both hands.

444
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,900
But when she was
on the warpath,

445
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
she held her weapons
in eight hands.

446
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,300
When the fire of her
vengeance twittled in her eyes

447
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,100
this smothering
goddess was wide awake

448
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,200
and everything in her
way got stained blood red.

449
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,300
The Bloody Benten

450
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,000
Nickname...
double B for short.

451
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,500
I was the one who
educated her in killing.

452
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,700
And it was tough going.

453
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,700
You like it?

454
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,765
Too sweet.

455
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,900
There's too much sugar.

456
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,100
This is Sukiyaki
not a damn pot!

457
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,400
I- I-I'm
so sorry!

458
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,500
How many times do
I gotta tell you,

459
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,100
before it sinks into that
thick skull of yours...

460
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,300
That you draw the sweetness
out of the Chinese cabbage.

461
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,900
And this Tofu...
its not authentic!

462
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,700
B
- But the Tofu was sold out!

463
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,500
Excuses!

464
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:03,700
Go on!

465
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,900
Darn excuses!

466
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:14,000
Dang useless woman, why I ever thought
I could make a gun fighter out of-

467
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,200
Listen up girl.

468
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,700
If this were a gun fight.

469
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:47,100
You wouldn't be sayin you got bullets
that shoot beans instead, now could ya?

470
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,100
That'd mean dud to me
and you wouldn't it?

471
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,700
Hmm? Wouldn't it?

472
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,600
That's my girl, there you go.

473
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,900
Never let your guard down.

474
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:03,100
The Grim Reaper hisself grows
in that pot, don't forget that.

475
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,400
I
- I...

476
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,400
The sugar!

477
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,400
Sugar helps me.

478
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,800
Lordy lord...

479
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,300
You ain't pregnant is you?

480
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,500
I reckon it will
be a bouncing boy.

481
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,400
*Sigh*

482
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,300
Aw heck!

483
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,500
You mean Akira?

484
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:59,000
Akira, how the lovely sound
of that name brings me back.

485
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,100
What can I say.

486
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,700
At the end, I am an
enemy of the cold dagger.

487
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,400
What?

488
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,100
How's my boy?

489
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,300
I saw...

490
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,800
That's why you've
come for them irons eh?

491
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,800
You tell her this for me.

492
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,300
"Sayonara dake ga jin sei da"

493
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,600
Life is all about goodbyes.

494
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,300
We are in your debt!

495
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,500
I'm surprised.

496
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,600
He's still alive.

497
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,300
I guess.

498
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,800
Every man's got
his own reasons.

499
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,600
For why he had
to keep on living.

500
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,100
Got a cold?

501
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,100
Don't you have one too?!

502
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,900
Amazing...

503
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,600
You are some freak of nature.

504
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,900
The old man's
medicine did the trick.

505
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,400
Thank ya.

506
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,900
You going, huh?

507
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,000
Yeah.

508
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,600
Going... where to?

509
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,900
To settle a score.

510
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,300
What score?

511
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,000
The town's got
nothing to do with you!

512
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,400
Shit just happens, thats all.

513
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,900
So the meaning of rivalry
is shit happens, heh?

514
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,300
Well I don't wanna run
from... "The Shit" anymore.

515
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,900
Shit...

516
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:51,200
If you don't take the cake, sorry but
could you fetch the treasure for me?

517
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,900
There is one?

518
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,400
Ruriko... what
about the town law?

519
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:07,100
As anyone who has been
getting around here knows,

520
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,800
he was chosen to guard it.

521
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,700
That's the town law.

522
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,500
I thought Heihahi would
be the next chosen one.

523
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,000
But he is too weak.

524
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,300
I reckon he was born
at the wrong time,

525
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,100
and in the wrong place.

526
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,500
He does have a gift
for music though.

527
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,200
But tenderness alone
won't get you far in life.

528
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,300
What're you going to
do with the treasure?

529
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,600
Settle this, once and for all!

530
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,500
If we lose, they can have it.

531
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:52,700
If we win, you can have
half... how about it? You game?

532
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,100
Suits me fine.

533
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,100
Okay then.

534
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:47,900
This way!

535
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,900
No! This way!

536
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,100
I ain't gonna listen
to you no more!

537
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:14,100
That's my line! I kill you!

538
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,000
Smells like victory.

539
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,900
Got the Mr. Gatling
riding shotgun.

540
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,400
And now a shield.

541
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,300
A shield?

542
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,800
If you won't fight,
it would be perfect.

543
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,000
Mwahaha!

544
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,300
Hey hey! Hold on!

545
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,000
Come on now!

546
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,100
Hey! No!

547
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,900
Shit!

548
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:18,100
If I get taken down... will
you get this to Heihachi for me?

549
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,100
I'll think about it.

550
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,500
If and when you die.

551
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,400
Hey! Hey!

552
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,500
I'll carry the
treasure for you.

553
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:32,500
I carried the gun, and
if the end carries you!

554
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,100
Then let me do it!

555
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:40,700
If you weren't the most
stubborn man I ever did meet.

556
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,200
Let him take it.

557
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,600
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

558
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,200
Go, go!

559
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,900
We get shot, and you are the one
thats gonna get smoked. Not me!

560
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,500
You die first!

561
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,400
No! You die first!

562
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,500
We die!

563
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:29,800
Ok we die, we die... I die, you
die, he dies, she dies, we die!

564
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,600
Everybody dies!

565
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:37,500
It takes truly something
for people to finally learn.

566
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,500
The way to your loyal
heart, with love.

567
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,500
Yoshitsune...

568
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,400
I'll make you...

569
01:34:58,700 --> 01:34:59,700
Notice me.

570
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,300
Here is...!

571
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,500
The treasure!

572
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,900
How about it boys?!

573
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,700
Winner takes all!

574
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,000
Hey look!

575
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,500
Gold!

576
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:35,800
Spread out!

577
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,300
Yoshitsune!

578
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,500
B
- Benkei?

579
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,300
So re!

580
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,800
Yoshitsune!

581
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:27,100
I think I sprained my ankle!

582
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:14,900
Where're those Heike boys?!

583
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:40,500
Here we go!

584
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,200
Yeah!

585
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,000
No!

586
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,800
Get down!

587
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,600
You've got a new toy?

588
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,000
Yoshitsune!

589
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,700
This time, we win!

590
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,500
This time, we win!

591
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,800
This time...

592
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,900
That's for the mayor.

593
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I win...

594
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,200
I win!

595
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,800
I ain't dead.

596
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,400
'Til I beat you.

597
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:28,200
This is for Akira.

598
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,200
Its all mine!

599
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,900
Its mine!

600
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,700
Its all ours!

601
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:19,200
I... always...

602
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:23,500
Don't say it...

603
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:42,900
No one in the world
ever saved Benten's life.

604
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,300
Except for you.

605
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:53,800
You...

606
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:02,800
You're Ruriko.

607
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,900
My... Ruriko.

608
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,900
Now this...

609
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,300
Is what I call class.

610
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:31,700
So that old granny,
was Bloody Benten.. eh?

611
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,900
I'm glad I came here.

612
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,300
Hell, I'm glad I was born.

613
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:44,500
Finally, with a
worthy opponent.

614
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,400
I can risk my
life to the death.

615
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,800
Victory...

616
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:28,600
...or death!

617
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,600
That's plenty for me.

618
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,900
You keep the rest.

619
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,200
Just do me one thing.

620
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,700
Tend to the roses for me.

621
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,500
But when it doesn't
feel right, you can stop.

622
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:24,900
Now you've got money, you got
the gun, and the roses too.

623
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,500
Heihachi...

624
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:38,500
Son, no matter what
the times may be.

625
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,500
No matter where you are.

626
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,400
What matters is you, and
how you deal with this world.

627
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:56,300
And there ain't
no running from it.

628
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:08,800
Don't run.

629
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:15,300
Decide for yourself
what tomorrow's gonna be.

630
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:34,800
Love.

631
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,100
Your mother was a
mighty fine lady.
