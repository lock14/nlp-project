1
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,649
Is there any legal reason
why sentence should not be pronounced?

2
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,359
- No, Your Honor.
- Yes.

3
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,944
I have something to say.

4
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,446
You can put me away,

5
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,531
but you can't put away
what's going to happen to you

6
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,658
and to this whole country next time.

7
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,327
Next time, we are going to...

8
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,121
Don't say anymore.
Leave that for the appeal.

9
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,876
It is the judgment of this court
that the defendant, John Huberman,

10
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,253
having been found guilty
of the crime of treason

11
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,006
against the United States
by the jury of this court

12
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,884
for the southern district of Florida
at Miami,

13
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,262
be committed to the custody
of the United States Attorney General

14
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,474
for imprisonment in an institution
of the penitentiary type

15
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,060
for a period of 20 years.

16
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,520
And the defendant may be
forthwith remanded

17
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,606
to the custody
of the United States Marshal.

18
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,900
- The court is now adjourned.
- Here she comes.

19
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,282
- Just a minute, Miss Huberman.
- Look this way, would you please?

20
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,119
We'd like a statement from you,
Miss Huberman, about your father.

21
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,538
For instance, do you think your father
got what he deserved?

22
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,706
Could we say you're pleased

23
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,917
your father's going to pay
for being a German worker?

24
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,505
Let us know if she tries to leave town.

25
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,521
Would you care to pause
for some refreshments, Mr. Hopkins?

26
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,440
Alicia, were you really followed
by a policeman?

27
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,608
It sounds very exciting.

28
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,026
I'm gonna shoot it out
with them tomorrow.

29
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,528
No, thanks. Had enough. So have you.

30
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,447
Now, don't be silly. The important
drinking hasn't started yet.

31
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,325
Everybody down here has got
a stuffed fish hanging on the wall.

32
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,160
Where'd they get it? Never seen a fish.

33
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,496
How about you, handsome?

34
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,165
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,502
Well, it doesn't matter.
I like party crashers.

36
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,338
He's not a party crasher. I brought him.

37
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,591
I wouldn't mind being followed by a cop.

38
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,429
I hate low, underhanded people
like policemen, pussyfooting after you.

39
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,222
Of course,
I'm a marked woman, you know.

40
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,850
I'm liable to blow up the Panama Canal
any minute now.

41
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,893
- You want some ice in it?
- No, thank you.

42
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,938
It's not becoming for a lovely girl
like you to be worried about policemen.

43
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,274
- You won't be tomorrow.
- Oh, really?

44
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,569
- We sail at 10:00.
- Really? We just sail away?

45
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,612
Show me a fish and I'll show you a liar.

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,990
What this party needs
is a little glam treatment.

47
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,285
We'd better start breaking up, Alicia.
We have to be on board at 9:00.

48
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,455
One week in Havana and this whole thing
about your father will have blown over.

49
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,123
Do you love me, Commodore?

50
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,125
You're a very beautiful woman.

51
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,127
I'll have another drink
to appreciate that.

52
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,295
Where are you going?

53
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,422
- Fishing.
- This time of night, you're mad.

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,299
- How about you? Still drinking?
- What's the difference?

55
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,469
- There's no fish, day or night.
- You know something? I like you.

56
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,180
Well, I'll see you on board,
Alicia, at 9:00.

57
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,723
I have to think that over.

58
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,517
You don't have to pack.
We'll pick up some things in Havana.

59
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,895
I think I'll have to leave him here
to dry out.

60
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:35,858
I'm very sorry, you all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

61
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,736
- Good night.
- Good night.

62
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,379
There's one more drink left apiece.
Shame about the ice.

63
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,673
- What is?
- Gone.

64
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,967
- Who's gone?
- The ice.

65
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,971
Why do you like that song?

66
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,437
Because it's a lot of hooey.

67
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,152
There's nothing like a love song
to give you a good laugh.

68
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,946
That's right.

69
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,785
It's stuffy in here, isn't it?

70
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,620
Might be.

71
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,372
What about...

72
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,876
...we have a picnic?

73
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,004
Outside?

74
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,096
It's too stuffy in here for a picnic.

75
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,559
- Want to finish that?
- Shame to leave it.

76
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,482
You're quite a boy.

77
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,747
- My car is outside.
- Naturally.

78
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,168
- Want to go for a ride?
- Very much.

79
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,507
What about your guests?

80
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,510
They'll crawl out under their own steam.

81
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,054
I'm gonna drive.

82
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,099
That's understood.

83
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,231
Don't you need a coat?

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,317
You'll do.

85
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,791
Wait a minute. Let me put this on you,
or you might catch cold.

86
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,438
- How am I doing?
- Not bad.

87
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,567
- Scared?
- No.

88
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:28,447
- No, you're not scared of anything.
- Not too much.

89
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,914
- This fog gets me.
- It's your hair in your eyes.

90
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,006
What does the speedometer say?

91
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,926
Sixty-five.

92
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,893
I want to make it 80,
and wipe that grin off your face.

93
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,523
I don't like gentlemen who grin at me.

94
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,578
- A cop.
- What?

95
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,873
A policeman is chasing us. Look.

96
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,292
They make me sick.

97
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,841
He wants to talk to you.

98
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,390
Drunken driving.
My second offense. Now I go to jail.

99
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,727
The whole family in jail. Who cares?

100
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,533
Having a time to yourself, aren't you?

101
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,495
People like you ought to be in bed.

102
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,205
- Drunk, huh?
- Just a minute, Officer.

103
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,876
No arguments, mister.
You ain't got a leg to stand on.

104
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,012
- Sorry, but you didn't speak up.
- That's all right.

105
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,639
- Sure you can handle it?
- No trouble.

106
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,099
You ought to know.

107
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,694
Where is the ticket?
He didn't give me a ticket.

108
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,117
- What's your name?
- Devlin.

109
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,913
You showed that cop something.
He saluted you.

110
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,083
- Did he?
- I saw him.

111
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,629
Why, you double-crossing buzzard.
You're a cop!

112
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,674
- All right, we'll argue later.
- Get away. Get out of my car.

113
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,677
- I'm gonna take you home.
- You're not going to take me home!

114
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,262
Move over.

115
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,308
Come on.

116
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,859
Get out of my car, federal cop.
You're crashing my party.

117
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,279
Just like that buzzard with the glasses.
Leave me alone!

118
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,198
You're trailing me
to get something on me.

119
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,578
Are you going to calm down?

120
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,748
Good. Now move over.

121
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,462
I'm not gonna...

122
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,235
You'd better drink that.

123
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,751
Why all this service?

124
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,420
Go on, drink it.

125
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,556
Finish it.

126
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,586
Feel better?

127
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,506
What do you care how I feel?

128
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,845
You... You cop.

129
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,822
What's this all about?

130
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,077
- What's your angle?
- What angle?

131
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,829
- About last night.
- Just wanted to be friends.

132
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,665
Friends. Yeah.

133
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,794
- So you could frame me?
- No. I've got a job for you.

134
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,338
Don't tell me. There's only...

135
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,804
There's only one job
that you coppers would want me for.

136
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,308
- Well, you can forget it, Mr...
- Devlin.

137
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,851
- What?
- Devlin.

138
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,938
I'm no stool pigeon, Mr. Devlin.

139
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,607
My department authorized me
to engage you to do some work for us.

140
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,109
It's a job in Brazil.

141
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,736
Go away. The whole thing bores me.

142
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,907
Some of the German gentry who were
paying your father are working in Rio.

143
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,869
- Ever hear of I.G. Farben industries?
- I tell you, I'm not interested.

144
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,164
Farben has men in South America
planted there before the war.

145
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,543
We're cooperating with the
Brazilian government to smoke them out.

146
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,921
- My chief thinks the daughter of a...
- Of a traitor?

147
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,384
He thinks you might be valuable in
the work. They might sort of trust you.

148
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,053
You could make up a little
for your daddy's peculiarities.

149
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,973
- Why should I?
- Patriotism.

150
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,975
That word gives me pain.

151
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,980
No, thank you.
I don't go for patriotism, or patriots.

152
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,732
I'd like to dispute that
with you.

153
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,818
Waving the flag with one hand
and picking pockets with the other.

154
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,488
That's your patriotism.
Well, you can have it.

155
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,908
We've had your bungalow wired
for three months.

156
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,578
"Conversation between John Huberman
and daughter Alicia,

157
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,749
"6:30 p.m., January 9, 1946,
at Miami Beach, Florida."

158
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,126
Some of the evidence
that wasn't used at the trial.

159
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,419
I don't want to hear that.

160
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,047
Relax, hard-boiled, and listen.

161
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:05,010
There is for both of us,
a mint of money in it, Alicia.

162
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,346
I told you before Christmas
I wouldn't do it.

163
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,390
You don't use your judgment.
You can have anything you want.

164
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,642
- The work is easy.
- I'm not listening, Father.

165
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,644
This is not your country,
is it?

166
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,065
My mother was born here.
We have American citizenship.

167
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,401
Where is your judgment?
In your feelings you are German.

168
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,695
You got to listen to me.
You don't know what we stand for.

169
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:28,575
I know what you stand for,
you and your murderous wife.

170
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,118
I've hated you ever since I found out.

171
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,121
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Stay on your side of the table!

172
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,915
Alicia, put your voice down.

173
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,378
I hate you all, and I love
this country. Do you understand that?

174
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,050
I love it. I'll see you all hang
before I raise a finger against it.

175
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,806
Now go on and get out of here,
or, so help me, I'll turn you in.

176
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:55,602
Don't ever come near me or speak
to me again about your rotten schemes.

177
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,235
Well, that doesn't prove much.

178
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,239
- I didn't turn him in.
- We didn't expect you to.

179
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,783
Well, what do you say?

180
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,747
Go away and leave me alone.

181
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,500
I have my own life to lead.

182
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,421
Good times, that's what I want,
and laughs with people I like.

183
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,717
And no underhanded cops who want
to put me up in a shooting gallery.

184
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,971
But people of my own kind,
who treat me right,

185
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,514
and like me and understand me.

186
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,934
Good morning, Alicia.

187
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,769
Hello.

188
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,647
Thought you might need a hand this
morning. We're sailing with the tide.

189
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,691
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

190
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,194
- Don't tell me you've forgotten, dear?
- Almost.

191
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,196
I'll help you pack.
Although you don't need anything.

192
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,116
- We got everything on board.
- Thank you. I'll pack myself.

193
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,827
We're moored at
the hotel pier. You know the spot.

194
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,788
- Yes.
- You're a darling.

195
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,582
Sweetest girl I ever knew.

196
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,209
See you soon.

197
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,590
Well, what about it?
Plane leaves tomorrow morning, early.

198
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,387
All right.

199
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,348
You better tell him.

200
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,680
I'll tell her.

201
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,182
See you later.

202
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,859
That's a very nice-looking man.

203
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,237
You'll be seeing him in Rio.

204
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,281
No, I won't be seeing any men in Rio.

205
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,493
Yes, you will.
That's our boss, Paul Prescott.

206
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,375
- Did he say anything about the job?
- No.

207
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,918
No hints?

208
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,506
No. He had some news about your father
he picked up at the last stop.

209
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,467
- What about him?
- He died this morning.

210
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,267
Oh.

211
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,894
- How?
- Poison capsule.

212
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,314
- He did it himself?
- Yes, in his cell.

213
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,317
Sorry.

214
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,822
I don't know why I should feel so bad.

215
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,869
When he told me a few years ago
what he was, everything went to pot.

216
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,414
I didn't care what happened to me.

217
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,917
Now I remember how nice he once was,

218
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,836
how nice we both were.

219
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,338
Very nice.

220
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,925
It's a very curious feeling.

221
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,596
As if something had happened to me,
and not to him.

222
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,641
You see, I don't have to
hate him anymore.

223
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,393
Or myself.

224
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,979
We're coming into Rio.

225
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,900
Yes. So we are.

226
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,094
I wonder if the Embassy or someone
can get me a maid.

227
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,556
It's a nice apartment and I don't mind
dusting and sweeping but I hate cooking.

228
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,724
I'll ask them.

229
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,060
While you're at it,
find out when I go to work,

230
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,227
- and on what.
- Yes, ma'am.

231
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,232
- Have another drink?
- No, thank you. I've had enough.

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,442
Whiskey and soda.

233
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,694
Well, did you hear that?

234
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,073
I'm practically on the wagon.
That's quite a change.

235
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,532
It's a phase.

236
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,118
You don't think a woman can change?

237
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,830
Sure. And change is fun. For a while.

238
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,457
For a while.

239
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,834
What a rat you are, Devlin.

240
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,463
All right. You've been sober
for eight days.

241
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,132
As far as I know,
you've made no new conquests.

242
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,093
Well, that's something.

243
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,095
Eight days.

244
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,846
Practically whitewashed.

245
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,349
I'm very happy, Dev.

246
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,978
- Why won't you let me be happy?
- Nobody's stopping you.

247
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,444
Why don't you give
that copper's brain of yours a rest?

248
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,448
Every time you look at me,
I can see it running over its slogans,

249
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,327
"Once a crook, always a crook.
Once a tramp, always a tramp."

250
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:11,042
Go on. You can hold my hand.
I won't blackmail you for it afterwards.

251
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,586
Scared?

252
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,715
I've always been scared of women,
but I get over it.

253
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,259
And now you're scared of yourself.

254
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,219
You're afraid you'll
fall in love with me.

255
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,138
That wouldn't be hard.

256
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,973
Now careful, careful.

257
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,058
You enjoy making fun of me, don't you?

258
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,564
No, Dev. I'm making fun of myself.

259
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,649
I'm pretending I'm a nice,
unspoiled child,

260
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,819
whose heart is full of daisies
and buttercups.

261
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,488
Nice daydream. Then what?

262
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:51,124
- I think I will have another drink.
- I thought you'd get around to it.

263
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,792
Make it a double.

264
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,467
Why won't you believe in me, Dev?

265
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,471
Just a little.

266
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,600
Why won't you?

267
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,281
I know why you won't, Dev.

268
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,784
You're sore.
You're sore because you've fallen

269
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,411
for the little drunk
you tailed in Miami,

270
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,040
and you don't like it.
It makes you sick all over, doesn't it?

271
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,333
People will laugh at you.

272
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,502
The invincible Devlin, in love
with someone who isn't worth

273
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,962
even wasting the words on. Poor Dev.

274
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,591
In love with a no-good gal.
It must be awful. I'm sorry...

275
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,389
Gentlemen, I assure you
she's the perfect type for the job.

276
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,726
It's not the girl. It's these
German scientists I'm worried about.

277
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,563
I simply question why we don't find
some way of taking them into custody.

278
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,942
It'd do no good. Even if you
arrest the leader, Alexander Sebastian,

279
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,820
tomorrow another Farben man
takes his place, their work goes on.

280
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,613
Yes, you're right.

281
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,616
I see, Captain Prescott,
your method is the best way.

282
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,327
Well, she's good
at making friends with gentlemen,

283
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,455
and we want somebody inside his house,
in his confidence.

284
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,707
You have faith in this procedure,
Captain Prescott?

285
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,875
Yes. With somebody on the inside...

286
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,336
- Have you consulted the young lady?
- No, not yet.

287
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,840
As a matter of fact, our man, Devlin,
brought her down here the other day.

288
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,133
Now we're waiting for Sebastian
to come back to Rio.

289
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,719
Has your Mr. Devlin told her
the nature of the work?

290
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,930
No. We haven't discussed it
with him at all,

291
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,557
but I can set your mind at rest
about her.

292
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,643
- You're sure of her political side?
- Oh, yes.

293
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,314
Well, there is nothing to be lost
if we proceed as you advise.

294
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,693
Now that's fine. I'll give Devlin
his instructions right away.

295
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,588
It's nice out here.

296
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,675
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.

297
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,511
We have to eat.

298
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,015
We can eat here. I'll cook.

299
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:59,437
- I thought you didn't like to cook.
- No, I don't like to cook.

300
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,652
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.

301
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,695
What about all the washing up
afterwards?

302
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,198
We'll eat it with our fingers.

303
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:15,578
- Don't we need any plates?
- Yes. One for you and one for me.

304
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,125
Would you mind
if I had dinner with you tonight?

305
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:26,255
I'd be delighted. Where are you going?

306
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,758
If we're gonna stay in,
I have to telephone the hotel,

307
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,510
see if there are any messages.

308
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,805
- Do you have to?
- I have to.

309
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,071
- This is a very strange love affair.
- Why?

310
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,159
Maybe the fact that you don't love me.

311
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,579
Hello, Palace Hotel?

312
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,251
This is T.R. Devlin.
Are there any messages for me?

313
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,255
When I don't love you,
I'll let you know.

314
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:11,426
- You haven't said anything.
- Actions speak louder than words.

315
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,429
There is? Good. Read it to me, please.

316
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,650
Prescott wants me over right away.

317
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,944
- Did he say what about?
- No.

318
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,322
- Maybe it's our assignment.
- Probably.

319
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,875
Want me to bring
anything back with me?

320
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:48,379
Yes. What about a nice bottle of wine
to celebrate?

321
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,259
- What time should I come back?
- 7:00.

322
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,141
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

323
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,369
What is it, Devlin?
What's the matter?

324
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,537
I don't know if she'll do it.

325
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,290
What do you mean you don't think... You
haven't discussed it with her, have you?

326
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,417
No. I didn't know
what the job was until this moment.

327
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,002
What do you mean she wouldn't do it?

328
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,588
Well, I don't think she's that type
of woman. She strikes me to be...

329
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,715
I don't understand your attitude.

330
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,595
- Why do you think she won't do it?
- Well, she's had no experience.

331
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:41,307
Come now. What experience
does she lack, do you think?

332
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,560
She's never been trained for that kind
of work. They'll see through her.

333
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,771
This woman was chosen
not only because her father

334
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,066
gives her an ideal background,
but because Sebastian knows her.

335
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,403
Yes. He was once in love with her.

336
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,282
I didn't know that.

337
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,827
I don't see why we're arguing
about petty things like this?

338
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,537
We've got important work to do.

339
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,330
Sebastian's house is a cover-up

340
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,666
for whatever this Farben Group is up to
here in Rio.

341
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,584
We've got to get Miss Huberman
inside that house

342
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,795
- and find out what's going on.
- Yes, that's right.

343
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,380
So I think you'd better go back
to Miss Huberman

344
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,298
and explain to her what she has to do.

345
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,466
I, uh...

346
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,677
- What is it?
- Nothing, sir.

347
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,304
I thought you were gonna say something.

348
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,223
How is the meeting to be arranged?

349
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:26,435
We discussed that. I think the
Riding Club would be the best place.

350
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,564
Sebastian usually rides there
in the mornings.

351
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,732
So the rest is up to you
and Miss Huberman.

352
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,529
- Okay, Devlin, that's all.
- All right.

353
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,128
- Dev, is that you?
- Uh-huh.

354
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,631
I'm glad you're late. This chicken
took longer than I expected.

355
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,966
What did they say?

356
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,552
Hope it isn't done too much.

357
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,263
It caught fire once.

358
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,558
I think it's better
if I cut it up out here,

359
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,644
unless you want a half of one
to yourself.

360
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,439
We're going to have knives and forks
after all.

361
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,108
I've decided we're going to
eat in style.

362
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,778
Marriage must be wonderful, with this
sort of thing going on every day.

363
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,909
I wonder if it's too cold out here.
Maybe we should eat inside.

364
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,500
Hasn't something like this
happened before?

365
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,297
What's the matter?

366
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,592
Don't look so tense. Troubles?

367
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,263
Well, handsome, I think
you better tell mama what's going on,

368
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,016
or all this secrecy is going to ruin
my little dinner.

369
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,687
Come on, Mr. D,
what is darkening your brow?

370
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,440
- After dinner.
- No, now.

371
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,695
Look, I'll make it easy for you.
The time has come when you must tell me

372
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,490
that you have a wife
and two adorable children,

373
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,576
and this madness between us
can't go on any longer.

374
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,870
I bet you've heard that line
often enough.

375
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,918
Right below the belt every time.

376
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,047
- That isn't fair, Dev.
- Skip it.

377
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,509
We have other things to talk about.
We've got a job.

378
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,971
So there is a job.

379
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,017
You remember a man named Sebastian?

380
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,980
- Alex Sebastian?
- Yes.

381
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,983
One of my father's friends, yes.

382
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,363
- He had quite a crush on you.
- I wasn't very responsive.

383
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,493
He's here. The head of a large
German business concern.

384
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,578
His family always had money.

385
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,039
He's part of the combine
that built the German war machine,

386
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,083
- and hopes to keep on going.
- Something big?

387
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,712
It has all the earmarks
of being something big.

388
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,463
We have to contact him.

389
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,398
Go on. Let's have all of it.

390
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,693
We're meeting him tomorrow.
The rest is up to you.

391
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,195
You've got to work on him and land him.

392
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:28,784
Mata Hari.
She makes love for the papers.

393
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,662
There are no papers. You land him.

394
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,497
Find out what's going on
inside his house,

395
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,792
what the group around him is up to,
and report to us.

396
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,882
I suppose you knew about this
pretty little job of mine all the time.

397
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,761
No, I only just found out about it.

398
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,722
Did you say anything?

399
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,560
I mean, that maybe I wasn't the girl
for such shenanigans.

400
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,857
I figured that was up to you,
if you'd care to back out.

401
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,817
I suppose you told them Alicia Huberman

402
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,403
will have this Sebastian eating
out of her hand in a couple of weeks.

403
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,782
- She's good at that. Always was.
- I didn't say anything.

404
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:15,623
Not a word for that little lovesick lady
you left an hour ago?

405
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:22,296
- I told you, that's the assignment.
- Well, now, don't get sore, Dev.

406
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,843
I'm only fishing for a little birdcall
from my dream man.

407
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,181
One little remark such as,

408
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:35,434
"How dare you gentlemen
suggest that Alicia Huberman,

409
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,605
"the new Miss Huberman,
be submitted to so ugly a fate?"

410
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,565
That's not funny.

411
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,573
Do you want me to take the job?

412
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,202
- You're answering for yourself.
- I am asking you.

413
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,787
It's up to you.

414
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,457
Not a peep?

415
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,505
Darling, what you didn't tell them,
tell me.

416
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,217
That you believe I'm nice, and that
I love you, and I'll never change back.

417
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,595
I'm waiting for your answer.

418
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,687
What a little pal you are.

419
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,525
Never believing me.

420
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,446
Not a word of faith.
Just down the drain with Alicia.

421
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,239
That's where she belongs.

422
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,993
Oh, Dev. Dev...

423
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,633
- When do I go to work for Uncle Sam?
- Tomorrow morning.

424
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,357
We shouldn't have had this
out here. It's all cold now.

425
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,652
What are you looking for?

426
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,655
I had a bottle of champagne.
I must have left it somewhere.

427
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,835
In case you're asked,
I'm with Pan American Airways.

428
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:29,131
- As Devlin?
- Yes. Public relations office.

429
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,674
Anything else?

430
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,594
No. Except, we met on the plane
coming in from Miami.

431
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,888
The less detail the better.

432
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,361
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yes.

433
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,280
We'll go by him easy.
Let him spot you. Come on.

434
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,354
I guess I'm the girl nobody remembers.

435
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,314
- Was it Sebastian?
- Yes.

436
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,316
We'll stick around,
give him another chance.

437
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,700
My dear Alicia.
Will you forgive me for being late?

438
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,453
Last-minute conference at the office.
You got my message?

439
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,413
Yes. It's all right, Alex.

440
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,748
Sweet of you to wait.

441
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,543
- I was afraid you might run off.
- I'm not that easily put off.

442
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,503
I was too anxious to meet you again.

443
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,672
You know, I'm tired.

444
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,301
The worst thing about business
is it makes you feel old and look old.

445
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,053
You seem to have escaped all of that.

446
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,722
Four years of dullness
and disintegration.

447
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,890
Awful.

448
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,476
Alex, you look younger
than you did in Washington.

449
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,979
It's a temporary improvement
entirely due to your presence, my dear.

450
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,898
You always affected me like a tonic.

451
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,817
Perhaps now, with you here in Rio,

452
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,112
unless you insist
on running away from me again.

453
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,324
- Would you like another drink?
- Yes, thank you.

454
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,168
You know him?

455
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,171
No, I don't think so,
but he seems familiar.

456
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,131
Captain Prescott. Intelligence man.

457
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,300
He's down here
as part of the Washington espionage.

458
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,636
The American Embassy's
loaded with them.

459
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,804
Really?

460
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,307
He's rather handsome, isn't he?

461
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,893
I'm allergic to American agents.

462
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,896
Their fine points
don't particularly appeal to me.

463
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,691
They've bothered you
since you came down?

464
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,943
No, not yet.

465
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,113
They were troublesome in Miami?

466
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,410
Yes, that's why I left after the trial,
to get away from their snooping.

467
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,080
I wondered why you left your father.

468
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,667
He insisted. He was so unselfish.

469
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,795
He kept worrying about me,
begging me to leave.

470
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,965
I had no idea he was going to die.

471
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:02,469
Many things have died for all of us.
We mustn't let our spirit die with them.

472
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,641
Perhaps I can help you to forget.
I'd like to.

473
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,185
It's odd,

474
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,023
but I feel at home with you.

475
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,154
You know, my dear,
I knew this was going to happen.

476
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,490
I knew, when we met the other day

477
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,909
that if I saw you again,
I'd feel what I used to for you.

478
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,037
The same hunger.

479
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,332
You're so lovely, my dear.

480
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,961
Now I'm going to make
a fool of myself again.

481
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:39,006
There's someone else, of course.
Who is it this time?

482
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,341
That Mr. Devlin you were with?

483
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,635
There is no one.

484
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,512
He seemed attentive.

485
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,809
Mr. Devlin has pestered me with his
attentiveness ever since I arrived.

486
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,061
I met him on a plane from Miami.

487
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,313
You made a pretty couple.

488
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,525
Oh, no, Alex.
Mr. Devlin doesn't interest me.

489
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:04,156
I was so lonely that day, I could have
gone riding with Peter Rabbit.

490
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,910
You'll let me help your loneliness?

491
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:14,374
You're very sweet to forget
what a brat I was once.

492
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,171
My dear, I shall test out
your repentance at once.

493
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,341
Will you have dinner with me again
tomorrow night?

494
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,385
- Thank you very much.
- My house?

495
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,514
Yes. How nice.

496
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,390
My mother's giving a dinner party.

497
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,017
She won't mind an extra guest?

498
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,020
An old friend is never an extra guest.

499
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,068
- Well, should we order now?
- Yes, I'm starved.

500
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,655
Now, let's see.

501
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,074
What shall we have
for our first dinner together?

502
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,840
Good evening.

503
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,424
Very good.

504
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,385
Yes. Yes, isn't it?

505
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,805
I'd like you to wear these.
They're rented for the occasion.

506
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,604
- Would you help me, please?
- Why, yes. Certainly.

507
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,691
- Thank you.
- So the old boy knew me?

508
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,776
Yes, he thought you were very handsome.

509
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,571
You don't say!
Sorry I'm not going with you.

510
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,447
- Dev will pick those up later.
- All right.

511
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,284
Try to memorize the names
of all the people you see there tonight.

512
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,493
The men, I mean.

513
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,495
And get their nationalities.
That's very important.

514
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,831
You mean the Germans?
That won't be difficult for me.

515
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,625
And I suggest
that you don't ask any questions.

516
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,252
Just use your eyes and ears.

517
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,797
They're a pretty keen and desperate
bunch. Don't underestimate them.

518
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,465
Thank you for your instructions.
Good evening.

519
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,510
By the way, unless you have something
very urgent to report,

520
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,847
I suggest you two keep shy of each other
for the next few days,

521
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,641
that's in case Sebastian's people
want to check on you after your visit.

522
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,476
- I understand. Good evening.
- That's all. Good luck.

523
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,644
Good night.

524
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,559
Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman. Will
you tell Mr. Sebastian that I'm here?

525
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,780
- Miss Huberman?
- Yes.

526
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,241
Please forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

527
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,409
Not at all.

528
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,370
You resemble your father very much.

529
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,705
I'm Alex's mother.

530
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,206
I knew when I saw you.

531
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:45,127
Alex has always admired you.
Now, at last, I know why.

532
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,753
You're very kind.

533
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,590
You did not testify at your father's
trial. We thought that unusual.

534
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,175
He didn't want me to.

535
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,261
He refused to let his lawyers
call me on the stand.

536
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,096
I wonder why.

537
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,431
Hello.

538
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,307
Alicia.

539
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,768
I'm so glad.

540
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,562
- You met my mother?
- Yes, we just met.

541
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,481
You didn't meet Alicia when we were
in Washington four years ago, did you?

542
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,066
I don't know where you were at the time.

543
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,028
Alex, I think we should join
our other guests.

544
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,700
- May I take your wrap?
- Thank you.

545
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,757
Miss Huberman, may I present
Eric Mathis.

546
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,885
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

547
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,846
William Rossner.

548
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,433
- How do you do?
- Very honored.

549
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,019
Emil Hupka.

550
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,021
How do you do?

551
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,648
Delighted.

552
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,317
And Mr. Knerr.

553
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,906
And Dr. Anderson.

554
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,616
Dr. Anderson.

555
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,619
It gives me great pleasure.

556
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,000
Dr. Anderson's our
guest of honor tonight.

557
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,837
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman,
Alex, with discourses on science.

558
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,882
- Not before dinner, anyway.
- Dinner is served, madame.

559
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:21,098
Dr. Anderson,
you will sit beside me over there.

560
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,643
Eric, you will sit
next to Miss Huberman.

561
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,229
You have just come from Spain, señora?

562
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,689
A few weeks ago. It seems ages.

563
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,527
Travel does not mean anything anymore.
It goes so swiftly.

564
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,862
- One has the feeling...
- That bottle doesn't belong here.

565
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,114
Shh. You're mistaken.

566
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,535
We can expect rocket ships to be
carrying us around the ocean very soon.

567
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,121
We can expect many strange things.

568
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,664
See a good movie this afternoon, Eric?

569
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,332
No, I was disappointed.

570
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,750
Must have been a comedy.

571
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,586
You know, Eric loves
to go to the movies to cry.

572
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,380
He's very sentimental.

573
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,678
It takes nearly as long
to go from the city to the airport,

574
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,805
as it does to cross the...

575
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,321
I'm afraid, gentlemen,
that something must be done about Emil.

576
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,408
I don't know.

577
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,411
It was an understandable slip.
The man was tired.

578
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,455
No. But it was a very dangerous slip.

579
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,792
It's not the first one. There have been
several other lapses before.

580
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,336
There will be more if you permit him.

581
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,047
That's bad. That's very bad.

582
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,633
I think, gentlemen,
you can leave it to me to find some way.

583
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,512
When you drive up to Petrópolis,
the road winds quite a bit.

584
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,389
It is very high.

585
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,017
There are some very awkward turns.

586
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,938
I'm sure I will not have any difficulty
in getting Emil to give me a lift.

587
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,191
It's quite a trick to jump clear.

588
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,611
I'll just have to be careful,
that is all.

589
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,864
Turned my ankle the last time.

590
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,420
Madame says will you join the others,
or will you take your coffee in here?

591
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,381
I think we'll take coffee in here, Emil.

592
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,594
I'm very sorry, gentlemen,

593
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,679
to make such an exhibition.

594
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,891
Nonsense. We all have nerves.

595
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,644
You have been overworking.

596
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,479
Don't you think, Sebastian?

597
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,522
You need to rest.

598
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,109
- Your health is very important to us.
- That's very considerate.

599
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,028
I am very tired,

600
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:44,616
so now, I think, perhaps
if you'll make my pardon to the ladies,

601
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,244
Alex, for my leaving so early, then I...

602
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,622
Maybe, Emil, it would be better
if I came with you.

603
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,833
Perhaps if you tried to drive yourself
all the way up to Petrópolis,

604
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,211
it might be too much for you.

605
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,213
I shall drive you.

606
00:45:58,506 --> 00:45:59,881
No.

607
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,801
That would be too much for you.
All that way, it is too much to ask.

608
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,262
Nonsense. I'd love to go.

609
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,472
Come on, Emil.

610
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,099
Good night, gentlemen.

611
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,809
Good night, Alex.

612
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,520
I hope you feel better
in the morning, Emil.

613
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:14,688
Thank you.

614
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:19,025
And I'm very sorry
to make a scene before strangers.

615
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,819
Very sorry.

616
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,988
Thank you, Alex,
for an excellent dinner.

617
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,491
And please tell your mother for me
that the dessert was superb.

618
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,672
Miss Huberman has been gone
a long time.

619
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,134
Mother, is it necessary for you to
always address Alicia as Miss Huberman?

620
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,303
I do wish you'd be
a little more cordial to her.

621
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,805
Really? I thought I was behaving
very well.

622
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,099
- Has she been complaining about me?
- No.

623
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,434
I'm grateful.

624
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,394
You might smile at her.

625
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,856
Wouldn't it be a little too much
if we both grinned at her like idiots?

626
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,774
Please, Mother, I want to enjoy myself.

627
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:03,862
- Is it so boring to sit with me alone?
- Not at all.

628
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,329
Hello.

629
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,496
- Hello.
- I thought I saw you.

630
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,914
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

631
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,125
- Great turnout, isn't it?
- Yes.

632
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,420
Where are they?

633
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,172
In a box, in the stands.

634
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,300
I don't think they can see us,
Alex and his mother.

635
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,428
Don't telephone me anymore.
Just rely upon my popping up.

636
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,890
- Can you hear me?
- Sure. Go ahead.

637
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,394
- Heard of a Dr. Anderson?
- No.

638
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,271
He's some kind of a scientist.

639
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:43,193
Kind face, 60 years old, gray hair,
deep crease in the forehead.

640
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,904
- Tall or short?
- Short.

641
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,574
- Emil Hupka. Heard of him?
- No.

642
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:55,830
He made quite a scene
about a wine bottle the other night.

643
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,374
Didn't like the vintage?

644
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,335
He seemed to think
there was something else in the bottle.

645
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,087
- Was there?
- No.

646
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,255
It was wine. We drank it.

647
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,634
Has he pulled anything since?

648
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,469
Haven't seen him since.

649
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,847
Anything else?

650
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,476
Nothing important.

651
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:20,146
Just a minor item,
but you may want it for the record.

652
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,481
What is it?

653
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:25,610
You can add Sebastian's name
to my list of playmates.

654
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,243
- Pretty fast work.
- That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

655
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,452
Skip it.

656
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,125
- Are you betting on this race?
- No.

657
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,627
Alex says Number 10 is sure to win.
He knows the owner.

658
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:43,962
Thanks for the tip.

659
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,131
Alex says they've been
holding him back, but...

660
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,592
I can't help recalling some of
your remarks about being a new woman.

661
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,344
Daisies and buttercups, wasn't it?

662
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,555
You idiot.

663
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,765
What are you sore about?
You knew very well what I was doing.

664
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,725
- Did I?
- You could've stopped me.

665
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,353
Just one word, but no, you wouldn't,
you threw me at him.

666
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,063
I threw you at nobody.

667
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,523
Didn't you tell me to go ahead?

668
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,276
A man doesn't tell a woman what to do,
she tells herself.

669
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,529
You almost had me believing
that hokey-pokey miracle of yours

670
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,739
that a woman like you
could ever change her spots.

671
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,075
- You're rotten.
- That's why I didn't try to stop you.

672
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,454
- The answer had to come from you.
- I see. Some kind of love test.

673
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,621
That's right.

674
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,666
You never believed in me, anyway,

675
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,294
- so what's the difference?
- Lucky for both of us I didn't.

676
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,088
It wouldn't have been pretty if I had
believed in you, if I'd figured,

677
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,675
"She'd never go through with this,
she's been made over by love."

678
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:35,430
If you only once had said
that you love me. Oh, Dev.

679
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,683
Listen, you chalked up another
boyfriend, that's all. No harm done.

680
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,059
I hate you.

681
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,604
There's no occasion to.
You're doing good work.

682
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,107
Number 10 is out in front, looks like
Sebastian knows how to pick them.

683
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,859
Is that all you have to say to me?

684
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,779
Dry your eyes, baby.
It's out of character.

685
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,824
Except keep on your toes,
it's a tough job we're on.

686
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,953
Snap out of it. Here comes Dreamboat.

687
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,083
Hello, Alex.
It was so exciting. A beautiful horse.

688
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,169
- Do you remember Mr. Devlin?
- How do you do?

689
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,713
Hello. Alicia tells me
you had a bet on Number 10.

690
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,716
Sorry I didn't get the tip earlier.
So long.

691
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,093
See you sometime, Dev.

692
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,221
It was a wonderful race,
did you have much money on the winner?

693
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,889
I didn't see the race.

694
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,600
Didn't you? I thought I saw you
looking through your field glasses.

695
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,353
I was watching you and your friend,
Mr. Devlin.

696
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,271
I presume that's why you left
my mother and me,

697
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,898
you had an appointment to meet him.

698
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,775
Don't be absurd.

699
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,652
I met him purely by accident.

700
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,820
You didn't seem very anxious
to get away from him.

701
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,366
- He's just...
- I watched you.

702
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,661
I thought maybe you're in love with him.

703
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,580
- Don't talk like that, I detest him.
- Really?

704
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,209
- He's very good-looking.
- Alex,

705
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,337
I've told you before.
Mr. Devlin doesn't mean a thing to me.

706
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,297
I'd like to be convinced.

707
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,300
Would you, maybe,
care to convince me, Alicia,

708
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,011
that Mr. Devlin means nothing to you?

709
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:04,727
Pleased to hear, Señor Barbosa, that our
little theatrical plan is working.

710
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,105
We've got hold of something concrete
for a change.

711
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,274
I'm delighted, gentlemen. What is it?

712
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,735
Professor Wilhelm Otto Renzeler
is working here in Brazil.

713
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,654
One of Germany's scientific wizards.

714
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,281
- I didn't know he was here.
- Oh, yes.

715
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,200
He's living and experimenting
in Sebastian's house.

716
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:20,410
They call him Dr. Anderson.

717
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,456
Excuse me, sir.

718
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,418
Miss Huberman wishes to see
Captain Prescott or Mr. Devlin.

719
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:29,877
What do you mean? She's here?

720
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,045
Yes, sir.

721
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,423
- Show her in, Ribero.
- Yes, sir.

722
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,550
I don't like this.
I don't like her coming here.

723
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:39,429
She's had me worried
for some time, a woman of that sort.

724
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,225
What sort is that, Mr. Beardsley?

725
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:47,270
I don't think any of us have illusions
about her character, have we, Devlin?

726
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,105
Not at all, not the slightest.

727
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,525
Miss Huberman is first, last,
and always not a lady.

728
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,903
She may be risking her life,
but when it comes to being a lady,

729
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,991
she doesn't hold a candle to your wife,
sitting in Washington, playing bridge

730
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,493
with three other ladies
of great honor and virtue.

731
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,454
- Take it easy, Dev.
- Sorry.

732
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,248
I think those remarks about my wife
are uncalled for.

733
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,584
Withdrawn. Apologize, sir.

734
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,132
- How do you do, Miss Huberman?
- How do you do?

735
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,302
This is Mr. Beardsley
and Señor Julio Barbosa.

736
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,220
- Care to sit down?
- Thank you.

737
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,556
You have the esteem
of my government, señorita.

738
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,558
But we are worried
about you visiting this office.

739
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,477
I promise not to break the rules again.

740
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,521
But I need some advice,
and I couldn't find Mr. Devlin.

741
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,815
In fact, I need it before lunch.

742
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:37,445
- Has something happened?
- Yes, something rather confusing.

743
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,615
Mr. Sebastian has asked me to marry him.

744
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,784
- What?
- Well, well.

745
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,956
He wants me to marry him right away,
and I'm to give him my answer at lunch.

746
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,502
I didn't know what the department
might think about such a step.

747
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,130
Are you willing
to go this far for us, Miss Huberman?

748
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,466
Yes, if you wish.

749
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,719
What do you think of this, Devlin?

750
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,723
I think it's a useful idea.

751
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,435
Well, you know the situation
better than any of us.

752
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,980
May I ask what inspired
Alex Sebastian to go this far?

753
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,733
He is in love with me.

754
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,736
And he thinks you're in love with him?

755
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,366
Yes, that's what he thinks.

756
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,077
Gentlemen,
it's the cream of the jest.

757
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,875
Then... Then it's all right?

758
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,213
Yes, I'd say so.

759
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,259
Of course,
it's a perfect marriage for us.

760
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,928
There's only one thing,
won't it delay us a bit?

761
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,638
What do you mean?

762
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,600
Mr. Sebastian is a very romantic fellow,
isn't he, Alicia?

763
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,437
Yes.

764
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,190
Then he'll probably want to take
his bride away for a long honeymoon.

765
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,483
Won't that hold us up?

766
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,944
- Devlin's got a point there.
- I don't know,

767
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:03,322
I think we can rely on Miss Huberman
to get back into the house quickly.

768
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,577
Yes, I think I can manage that.

769
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,289
Everything seems to be nicely arranged.

770
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:14,000
I don't think you need me here anymore,
do you, Captain Prescott?

771
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:19,338
I do want to thank you,
Miss Huberman, very much.

772
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,382
I think, so far,
everything has been managed

773
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,511
- with great intelligence.
- Yes, thank you very much.

774
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,556
Are you quite sure
she didn't come down here to see you?

775
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,225
To capture the rich Alex Sebastian
for a husband?

776
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,561
Don't be absurd, Mother,
she didn't even know I was here.

777
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:37,857
- We will discuss it more fully tonight.
- We will not discuss it tonight.

778
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,615
You know, all these carping questions

779
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,450
are merely the expression
of your own jealousy,

780
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,243
just as you've always been jealous
of any woman

781
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,661
I've ever shown any interest in.

782
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,747
In this case,
there's nothing more to discuss.

783
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,666
You mean, then,
you are going ahead with this marriage?

784
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,671
I mean that the wedding
will be next week.

785
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,965
It'll be private.

786
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:07,011
We shall both be pleased
to have you present if you wish.

787
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,630
- Good evening, sir, madame.
- Good evening, Joseph.

788
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,591
It doesn't look very cheerful here.

789
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:49,303
I'm sorry, sir. Madame Sebastian
wasn't certain you'd be back tonight.

790
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,013
Why not? I telegraphed her.

791
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,433
Madame Sebastian said
we were all to retire, sir.

792
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,852
Where is my mother?

793
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,980
Madame Sebastian went to bed
very early, sir.

794
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,024
I'm sorry, my dear. I'm afraid this
isn't a very bright homecoming for you.

795
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,401
That's all right, Alex.

796
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:06,404
Well, what shall we do? Shall we have
Joseph arrange for food for us?

797
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,781
Not unless you want to.
I'm rather tired myself.

798
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,950
We'll go right up, then.

799
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,119
- Good night.
- Good night.

800
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,667
I'd like to have all my dresses
put out on the bed here.

801
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:22,044
Don't hang anything up,
I like to know where everything goes.

802
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,172
- Joseph, did you have the closets aired?
- Yes, madame.

803
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,390
This isn't very large.
I'll need more room.

804
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,443
This door is locked.

805
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,945
That's used for a storeroom, madame.

806
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,741
- May I have the key?
- I do not have the keys, madame.

807
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:52,909
Where are they?

808
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,454
Madame Sebastian has charge
of all the house keys, madame.

809
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,706
Oh.

810
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,751
Do you know where Mr. Sebastian is?

811
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:06,005
I believe he's having a business meeting
downstairs in the study, madame.

812
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,592
I miss Hupka.

813
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,470
He was a first-class metallurgist.

814
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,639
Gleichen is just as good.

815
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,515
Such is your opinion.

816
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,269
But I don't want to criticize.
What were you asking?

817
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,314
You want a report, a written report.

818
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:27,401
Well, my friends, my work is done.

819
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,238
- You've been successful?
- Yes.

820
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,831
- I'm very sorry. I...
- Not at all.

821
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,625
- Come on in.
- No. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

822
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:43,793
I didn't know you were busy.

823
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,838
Some of the closets are locked.
Could you give me the keys?

824
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,882
I'm so sorry.
I'd forgotten about the keys.

825
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,134
Of course,
I'll get them for you at once.

826
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,353
I'll bring the keys to you
right away, my dear.

827
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:07,316
Mother? Mother?

828
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,526
Come in.

829
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,281
Mother, Alicia wants the closet keys.

830
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,870
Mother, stop arguing!
Give me those keys!

831
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,539
I will not!

832
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,251
Mother, will you please
give me the keys?

833
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:27,878
Thank you.

834
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,725
There they are.

835
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,935
Afraid I'm going to be busy the rest
of the morning, my dear.

836
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,270
See you at lunch.

837
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,813
Thank you, dear.

838
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:05,332
Mr. Sebastian has the key for this,
madame. It's the wine cellar.

839
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,767
Then the wine cellar's
the obvious place to look.

840
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,561
Alex has the key to that.

841
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,354
Then get it from him.

842
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,273
Get it? How?

843
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,984
Don't you live near him?

844
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,156
- What do I look for if I get the key?
- You look for a bottle of wine,

845
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,742
like the one that rattled
the fellow at dinner that night.

846
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,996
All the bottles look alike to me.
I'm no mastermind.

847
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,957
You're doing all right.

848
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,045
It's no fun, Dev.

849
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,049
Too late for that now, isn't it?

850
00:59:56,635 --> 01:00:00,554
Look, why don't you persuade
your husband to throw a large shindig,

851
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:04,350
so he can introduce his bride
to Rio society, say sometime next week?

852
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:05,601
Why?

853
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,478
Consider me invited,

854
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,481
and I'll try and find out
about that wine cellar business.

855
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:17,571
I don't think my husband is interested
in entertaining just yet.

856
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,324
The honeymoon isn't over, huh?

857
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:26,247
Don't underestimate your charms,
Mrs. Sebastian. You can handle it.

858
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,165
I don't think it's going to be
so easy about you.

859
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,459
He thinks you're in love with me.

860
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,753
Tell him you thought
if you invited me to the house,

861
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,923
and I saw how happily married you were,

862
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,969
then the horrid passion I have for you
might be torn out of me.

863
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,513
That sounds very logical.

864
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,349
Good, next week, then. And get the key.

865
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,727
I have to fly up to Berlin,
but I'll be back in time.

866
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,357
All right. I'll be looking forward
to seeing you.

867
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,943
It's always a pleasure
meeting you, madame.

868
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,733
I'm surprised
at Mr. Devlin coming tonight.

869
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,569
I don't blame anyone
for being in love with you, darling.

870
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,654
I just hope that

871
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,657
nothing will happen to give him
any false impressions.

872
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,201
I'll be with you in a minute.

873
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,379
Darling.

874
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,594
It's not that I don't trust you,
but when you're in love at my age,

875
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,554
every man who looks at your woman
is a menace.

876
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,932
Forgive me for even talking about it.

877
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,309
I'm very contrite.

878
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,621
Well, I think we might join
the rest of the party now.

879
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,165
I think all our guests are here.

880
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,675
Where can I find Madame Sebastian?

881
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,636
- Go right in the drawing room, sir.
- Thank you.

882
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,822
- Hello, Dev.
- Good evening.

883
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,582
You haven't seen the house, have you?

884
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,500
No, it's quite a jolly little cottage.

885
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,294
Let me show you around the place.

886
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:01,879
Later. His nibs is on the trail.

887
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,301
- Mr. Devlin. Glad to see you.
- Good evening.

888
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,094
It's kind of your bride to invite me.

889
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,347
We both invite you, Mr. Devlin.

890
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,141
You will see that our guest is fed,
my dear, and amused.

891
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:16,643
You know... Excuse me.

892
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,731
Madame Estorik, I'm so glad to see you.

893
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,986
- This isn't going to be easy.
- Why?

894
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,366
He's quite sensitive about you.
He's going to watch us like a hawk.

895
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,993
Yes, he's rather jealous
of anyone who...

896
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:36,121
- Where'd you get the key, off his chain?
- Yes.

897
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,793
Let's hope the liquor doesn't run out
and start him down the cellar for more.

898
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,170
I hadn't thought about that.

899
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,963
Quite a point.

900
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,177
Thank you.

901
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,305
- Mr. Devlin, how nice. You remember me?
- Señora Ortiz.

902
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:56,350
How sweet.
Young men usually have short memories.

903
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:58,852
Here's something I adore, champagne.

904
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,397
May I?

905
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,906
- Joseph.
- Madame?

906
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:14,159
Do you think you have enough champagne
to last for the rest of the evening?

907
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,954
I don't know, madame. I hope so.

908
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,807
- Enjoying yourself, Mr. Devlin?
- Very much, thank you.

909
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,726
There are so many things
I would like to ask about the States.

910
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,687
I haven't heard anything
for a long time.

911
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:42,938
I'll be glad to tell you.

912
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:46,108
- Will you excuse me, Señora Ortiz?
- Would you mind?

913
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,333
- We'd better hurry.
- Lots of time.

914
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,753
No. Joseph might have to ask Alex
for more wine.

915
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,716
He's running out faster than he thought.

916
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:14,803
I'm sorry to hear that. Is he watching?

917
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,139
Yes. You'd better go out
in the garden alone,

918
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,976
wait around the back of the house,
and I'll show you the wine cellar door.

919
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,573
- Nice party, isn't it?
- It's a wonderful party.

920
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,493
I think you've done it wonderfully well.
I'm very proud.

921
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,077
Mr. Devlin bothering you much?

922
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,122
No, darling.
He's trying to drown his sorrow.

923
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:26,291
Excuse me. I think I'll ask the
orchestra to play some Brazilian music.

924
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,211
- They've played waltzes all evening.
- All right, dear.

925
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,317
- That's the door.
- All right.

926
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:59,616
I'll keep the garden door open
and I'll tell you if anything happens.

927
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,350
What's happened?

928
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,228
Look, vintage sand.

929
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,609
We've got to leave things
as we found them.

930
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:18,028
Help me find a bottle of wine,
with the same label as these others.

931
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:22,366
- It isn't really sand, is it?
- No, It's some kind of metal ore.

932
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,467
- This is a bit weird.
- I'm terrified.

933
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:43,428
Just pretend you're a janitor.
Janitors are never terrified.

934
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,472
I have a feeling we're very slow.

935
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,140
We're on schedule. Take it easy.

936
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,476
I keep hearing someone coming.

937
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:51,144
That'll be nice.

938
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:55,607
- Think, if he comes down with Joseph.
- Unfortunate.

939
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,140
Someone is coming.

940
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,351
Alex, he's seen us.

941
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,936
Wait a minute, I'm going to kiss you.

942
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,064
- No, he'll only think...
- That's what I want him to think.

943
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,488
You'd better stay upstairs, Joseph.
They may need you.

944
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:44,865
Yes, sir.

945
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,205
Oh, Dev, Dev.

946
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,883
Push me away.

947
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,556
I'm sorry to intrude
on this tender scene.

948
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,058
I couldn't help what happened.
He's been drinking.

949
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,187
So he carried you down here?

950
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,563
Please, Alex.

951
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,065
You love him.

952
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,193
No. Of course not. Please go.

953
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,404
For what it's worth, as an apology,
your wife is telling the truth.

954
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,740
I knew her before you,
loved her before you,

955
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,950
but I wasn't as lucky as you.

956
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,118
Sorry, Alicia.

957
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,828
- Please go.
- Good night.

958
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,252
Alex, don't be foolish.

959
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,631
I came down here because he threatened
to make a scene unless I see him alone.

960
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:44,424
He kissed you.

961
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,968
I couldn't stop him. I tried.

962
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,970
We'll talk about it later.

963
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,265
Your guests are upstairs.

964
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,226
Will you please go to them?

965
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,237
Mr. Devlin, are you going so soon?

966
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,531
Yes, I'm afraid I have to be up
early in the morning.

967
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,324
Thank you and good night.

968
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,622
- Joseph.
- Yes, sir?

969
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,416
- We'll go down for the wine now.
- Yes, sir.

970
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,440
You know, Joseph,

971
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,777
I don't think we need
give them any more champagne.

972
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,612
We still have some upstairs, haven't we?

973
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,573
Yes, sir.

974
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,367
And some whiskey and wine?

975
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,995
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I think we'll give them that.

976
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,758
I'm sorry about what happened, Alex.

977
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:13,889
My dear, I shall never forgive myself
for behaving like a stupid schoolboy.

978
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:16,558
Then you believe me?

979
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,810
Of course. It isn't worth
mentioning again.

980
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,563
Thank you. Are you coming up?

981
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:25,233
Not for a little while. Dr. Anderson's
waiting for me in the study.

982
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:30,196
Sleep well.
It was a very successful party.

983
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,032
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

984
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,159
Thanks for being so nice.

985
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,741
Mother.

986
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,245
Mother.

987
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,172
Why are you up so early?

988
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,425
I need your help.

989
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,720
Something is wrong?

990
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:26,516
A great deal. Alicia.

991
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,939
I have expected it.

992
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,316
I knew. I knew.

993
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,026
What is it?

994
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,236
Mr. Devlin?

995
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:40,905
No.

996
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,996
I am married to an American agent.

997
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:22,155
Yes. It is easy to see now.

998
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,741
I knew, but I didn't see.

999
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,784
They picked her because of her father.

1000
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,579
I must have been insane, mad,

1001
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,999
behaved like an idiot, to believe in her
with her clinging kisses.

1002
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,376
Stop wallowing in your foul memories.

1003
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,795
Well, what do I do?

1004
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,340
There's nothing to do.
I'm done, finished.

1005
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,511
- They'll find out.
- They won't find out.

1006
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,222
They'll find out what I'm married to.

1007
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,391
Look what they did to Emil Hupka.
Emil who did nothing.

1008
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,270
And I've betrayed them, I've bungled,
and there's no excuse.

1009
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,233
I'd do the same myself,
kill the fool who betrayed them.

1010
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,527
- There's no need for them to find out.
- Mathis is very sharp.

1011
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,822
Yes. He dislikes you. But his criticism
of your talents wouldn't go

1012
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:08,743
that far to imagine that you are married
to an American agent.

1013
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:13,122
We are protected by the enormity
of your stupidity for a time.

1014
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,417
- Alicia, I'll take care of her myself.
- No, not that way.

1015
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,504
I stood looking at her
when she was asleep.

1016
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:22,590
- I could have...
- Quiet, Alex.

1017
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,804
You're almost as impetuous
as before your wedding.

1018
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,473
You barred me from that episode.

1019
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,642
Let me arrange this one.

1020
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:36,354
Listen to me,
no one must know what she is.

1021
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,649
There must be no suspicion of her,
of you, or me.

1022
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:45,780
She must be allowed to move about freely
but she will be on a leash.

1023
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,825
She will learn nothing further
to inform.

1024
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,913
She must go, but it must happen slowly.

1025
01:19:54,540 --> 01:20:00,086
If she could become ill
and remain ill for a time until...

1026
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,973
Drink your coffee, darling,
it's getting cold.

1027
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,933
Are you going out this afternoon, Alex?

1028
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:18,229
No my dear, I have some letters
to write. What are you going to do?

1029
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:20,523
I just have a little shopping.

1030
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,609
I'd like to go to the Imperiale
and maybe I'll go to Cosmos and see

1031
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,528
if they have any new books in
from New York.

1032
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:26,696
If you're going down there,

1033
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:29,657
will you go to Suzette Crew's
to see if my cigars have arrived?

1034
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,200
Should be about 1,000 of them.

1035
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:34,329
If they have, ask them to keep them
in the humidor for me, will you?

1036
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:42,503
- Anything wrong?
- No. The light bothers me.

1037
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,547
I have a bit of a headache.
Would you mind...

1038
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,759
- Yes, I think we can fix that.
- Thank you.

1039
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:52,013
You know, some people get too much sun
down here. You must be careful.

1040
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:57,602
I think you can be
very proud of yourself, Mrs. Sebastian.

1041
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,147
That sand that Devlin brought in
shows uranium ore.

1042
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:04,275
So now we know what we're driving at.
Your job from now on

1043
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:08,196
will be to try to help
us find out where that sand comes from.

1044
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:11,449
The location of the uranium deposit
is of vast importance,

1045
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,284
and we're putting
quite a few people on it.

1046
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:16,120
But I think you'll be of great help.

1047
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,330
All right.

1048
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,416
But that isn't the main reason why
I asked you to come here this afternoon.

1049
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,419
- No?
- No, I wanted to tell you that

1050
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,589
I'm going to change your contact
in about a week.

1051
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:29,384
Mr. Devlin's been transferred to Spain.

1052
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,719
To Spain?

1053
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,305
Does Mr. Devlin know that?

1054
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,849
- Yes. He asked for the transfer.
- Why?

1055
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,352
Well, I guess he thought
he was going stale here.

1056
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,604
He wants to leave Rio?

1057
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:45,858
Yes. I guess he thought
he'd find Spain more interesting.

1058
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:49,862
Yes, I imagine it would be.
There really isn't very much

1059
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,949
for a brainy fellow like Mr. Devlin
to do in Rio anymore.

1060
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,743
Well, of course,
it is more or less routine now.

1061
01:21:57,704 --> 01:22:01,582
In the meantime,
I'm to report to Mr. Devlin as usual?

1062
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,502
Yes. He'll be here
until the new man arrives.

1063
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,088
Thank you, Captain Prescott.

1064
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,674
I'll keep my ears wide open. Goodbye.

1065
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,717
Goodbye. And...

1066
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,720
Go easy on that sun.

1067
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,444
Darling, what is it?

1068
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:30,903
I don't know.

1069
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:34,907
- Are you in pain?
- Yes, I'm so dizzy.

1070
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,617
What happened to her?

1071
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,369
We were walking
and she was stricken suddenly.

1072
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:41,497
I'll be all right. Let's go inside.

1073
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,521
I'm sorry I couldn't make it on time.

1074
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:08,649
It gets a bit lonely
squatting on a bench all day.

1075
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,819
Yes, Rio can be a very dull town.

1076
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,779
What's new?

1077
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,324
Nothing. What's new with you?

1078
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:17,909
Nothing.

1079
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:23,664
Any domestic troubles
about the other night?

1080
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:24,916
No.

1081
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,835
Any footprints in that sand, yet?

1082
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,754
No, nothing yet.

1083
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,256
Just a social visit?

1084
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,593
A little fresh air helps.

1085
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:37,678
You don't look so hot.

1086
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,308
- Well...
- Sick?

1087
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,229
No, hangover.

1088
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:51,526
That's news. Back to the bottle again?

1089
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:55,321
It sort of lightens my chores.

1090
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:58,699
- Big party?
- Just the family circle.

1091
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,327
Sounds quite jolly.

1092
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,162
It helps life in a dull town.

1093
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:05,831
You ought to take it easy
on that liquor.

1094
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:12,838
Don't you find Rio
a little hard to take, too?

1095
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,716
Not a bad town.

1096
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:21,556
You look all mashed up.
Must have been quite an evening.

1097
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,558
Yeah, it was.

1098
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:27,103
Okay, if you want to play that way,
go on, have fun,

1099
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,854
no reason why you shouldn't.

1100
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:30,189
That's right, Dev.

1101
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:33,776
Here's something that belongs to you.
I should have given it to you sooner.

1102
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,194
What is it?

1103
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:38,197
A scarf that you lent me once in Miami.

1104
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,122
Cleaning house?

1105
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,169
Goodbye, Dev.

1106
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:56,132
What do you mean, goodbye?

1107
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,884
Nothing. Just goodbye.

1108
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:02,471
Fresh air isn't as good for a hangover
as I thought.

1109
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,557
Sit down. You're still tight.

1110
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:06,392
I don't want to.

1111
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:10,521
Where are you going?

1112
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,189
Back home.

1113
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,656
You are not taking care
of yourself, Alicia.

1114
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,783
I feel much better.

1115
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,994
You look like something awful.

1116
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,956
Circles under the eyes.

1117
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:35,796
My dear child, you must have a doctor
find out what is the matter with you.

1118
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,507
I never go near doctors.

1119
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:41,802
They always want to cart you off
to a hospital.

1120
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,388
Maybe you belong in a hospital.

1121
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:49,894
Tell me, when did you first feel sick?

1122
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:53,856
I don't remember.

1123
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,734
Maybe the party, I think.

1124
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:59,570
I still think a sea trip
would be much better for you, darling,

1125
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:01,489
than doctors and hospitals.

1126
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,325
A little cruise somewhere. Maybe Spain?

1127
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,243
Put the roses back in your cheeks,
my sweet.

1128
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,954
I don't think so.
I don't care much for boats.

1129
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:10,790
We could go together, my dear,

1130
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:14,043
if you could bear to leave Alex behind
for a few weeks.

1131
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:17,880
I think I prefer Alex
to a case of seasickness.

1132
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,676
I always get seasick.

1133
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,846
Then you might like the mountains.

1134
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,558
The air is fresh and pure.

1135
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,477
I am going next week.

1136
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,312
You're leaving?

1137
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,523
I'm sorry. I'll miss you.

1138
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:39,485
Yes. I'm delaying my work too long.

1139
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:43,948
If you come with me,
the mountains won't make you seasick.

1140
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:48,202
And the Aymores mountains are beautiful,
covered with flowers and...

1141
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:52,832
No. What Alicia needs is rest,
not mountain climbing.

1142
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:55,292
I have heard about the Aymores.

1143
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,002
Did you? Really?

1144
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:00,756
Yes.

1145
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:05,136
The beautiful little native towns.
Tell me, are you going to Leopoldina?

1146
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:09,223
- No, no. I am going to Santa...
- Care for some more brandy, Otto?

1147
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,684
No, no, thank you.

1148
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:16,063
I never drink more than one brandy,
and even this is sometimes too much.

1149
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,940
I'll just finish my coffee.

1150
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,317
- No, that is...
- But that's Alicia's...

1151
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:22,862
Oh, I'm sorry.

1152
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:27,324
Perhaps Alex is right, my dear child.

1153
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:30,035
When you are young,
rest is the best doctor.

1154
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:37,293
And if you lie still for a few days,
reading, relaxing,

1155
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:42,673
forgetting all your troubles, it might
be as well as medicine or sea air.

1156
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:47,470
When I come back, you will be all well,
making us all very happy once more.

1157
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:56,145
Excuse me. I want to go to bed, I think.

1158
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,189
Pain again, darling?

1159
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,232
I'm sorry to complain.

1160
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,904
Shall I take you up to your room?

1161
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:08,657
May I help
you, my dear, some hot water, maybe?

1162
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,663
No, please, don't bother.

1163
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,416
I'll be all right.

1164
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:21,378
If you don't feel better in
the morning, I insist you call a doctor.

1165
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,215
I don't like
the way she looks, Alex.

1166
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:25,841
I'm worried about her.

1167
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,999
Alicia?

1168
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,459
Joseph, help me lift her.

1169
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,586
We must take her up to bed.

1170
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,172
Come, my dear.

1171
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,598
I told you she is sick.

1172
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:16,725
Don't exert yourself.

1173
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,060
Be quiet.

1174
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,605
No. Go! Go away!

1175
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,023
No!

1176
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,661
No, I don't want to.

1177
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:39,123
Some sort of spasm.
I'm sure it's not serious.

1178
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,958
We must get a doctor.

1179
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,960
The poor child is suffering too much.

1180
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,379
I'll call the hospital.
I'll get Dr. de Sa.

1181
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:48,173
Don't worry, dear Otto.
We'll get a doctor.

1182
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:51,260
A good one.
We'll take the best care of her.

1183
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:57,016
Joseph, disconnect the telephone.

1184
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,393
Madame must have absolute quiet.

1185
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:01,437
Take it out of the room, Joseph.

1186
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:30,549
Five days, eh?

1187
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:33,052
Say, that must be
quite a binge she's on.

1188
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,637
I don't think so.

1189
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:37,932
Well, you said she was drinking
last week, drunk when you saw her.

1190
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,393
- Yes but I've had time to think it over.
- Think what over?

1191
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:43,979
That drinking of hers,
I don't believe it.

1192
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,649
Why should she lie to you about that?

1193
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:50,277
Don't know.
She wasn't drunk, she was sick.

1194
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,321
Maybe that's why she hasn't shown up.

1195
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:54,156
She looked like
the ragged end of nowhere.

1196
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:56,116
Well, still sounds like
a hangover to me.

1197
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,701
Yes. I'm going to pay a call.

1198
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,454
Wait a minute,
I don't want you to mess things up.

1199
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,539
We hope to close this case out
in a few days.

1200
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:05,793
I won't mess anything up.
Just a social call.

1201
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:07,252
I'm a friend of the family.

1202
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:10,839
All right, go ahead if you want to.
But don't take any chances.

1203
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:13,425
And call me up when you get back.

1204
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,344
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

1205
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:42,413
Good evening, sir.

1206
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,623
Good evening. Family home tonight?

1207
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:45,791
Yes, sir.

1208
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:48,961
Would you mind telling Mr. Sebastian
that Mr. Devlin is here?

1209
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,340
- What is it, Joseph?
- I'm very sorry, sir,

1210
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,802
but since Mr. Sebastian asked me
not to disturb him, I don't know...

1211
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:57,970
Asleep?

1212
01:31:58,138 --> 01:32:01,140
No, sir. He's in the study
with some business associates.

1213
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,143
- How long do you think he'll be tied up?
- I don't know, sir.

1214
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,103
Mrs. Sebastian home?

1215
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,355
- Yes, sir.
- Would you mind telling her?

1216
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,566
- I'm afraid I can't, sir.
- Why not?

1217
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:14,111
Mrs. Sebastian is very ill
and confined to her bed.

1218
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:18,073
I'm sorry to hear that.
How long has she been ill?

1219
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,366
A week.

1220
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,368
- Has she had a doctor?
- I think so, sir.

1221
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,704
We are all very concerned about her.

1222
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:27,916
If you will wait here, Mr. Devlin,
I'll tell Mr. Sebastian.

1223
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,334
Right.

1224
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,094
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it, Joseph?

1225
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,596
Mr. Devlin to see you, sir.

1226
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:43,057
Oh.

1227
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,142
Tell him I'll be with him in a minute,
will you?

1228
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,393
Yes, sir.

1229
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:51,607
Go on, Professor.
This sounds serious to me.

1230
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:53,025
To me, also.

1231
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:54,777
What happened Monday?

1232
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:56,487
Same thing.

1233
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:59,406
When I left the bank,
a man was following me.

1234
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:02,993
But this morning
when I went to the ticket office,

1235
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:06,038
the same man came inside
and stood beside me.

1236
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,899
Alicia. Alicia.

1237
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:27,077
- Alicia, what's wrong with you?
- I'm so glad you came.

1238
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,789
I had to.

1239
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:34,793
I couldn't stand any more
waiting and worrying about you.

1240
01:34:36,171 --> 01:34:38,463
That wasn't a hangover you had that day.

1241
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,591
You were sick then.

1242
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:43,760
- What is it?
- Yes, I was sick then.

1243
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,639
What's wrong with you, Alicia?

1244
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:49,516
Oh, Dev.

1245
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,603
What is it, dear? What's wrong with you?

1246
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:55,606
They're poisoning me.

1247
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:58,400
I couldn't get away from them.

1248
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,611
I tried, but I was too weak.

1249
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,196
How long?

1250
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:06,158
Since the party.

1251
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:08,952
Alex and his mother found out.

1252
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,292
Come on. Try and sit up.

1253
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,793
Sit up.

1254
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,545
I've got to get you out of here.

1255
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:21,215
I thought you had gone.

1256
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:24,968
No, I had to see you once
and speak my piece.

1257
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:27,512
I was getting out because I love you.

1258
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,182
I couldn't bear seeing you
and him together.

1259
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,191
You love me.

1260
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:42,277
Why didn't you tell me before?

1261
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:43,779
I know.

1262
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:46,657
I couldn't see straight
or think straight.

1263
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:51,745
I was a fatheaded guy, full of pain.

1264
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:53,997
It tore me up not having you.

1265
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:58,252
You love me.

1266
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:01,505
You love me.

1267
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:04,424
Long ago, all the time,
since the beginning.

1268
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,597
Here, put on your robe.

1269
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,600
Come on.

1270
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:16,353
Try to sit up.

1271
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:22,901
Dev, I'm afraid I can't make it.

1272
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:26,113
They gave me pills to sleep.

1273
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:28,490
Keep awake. Keep talking.

1274
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:32,786
- Have you got a coat?
- In the closet.

1275
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,331
They didn't want the others
to know about me.

1276
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:44,756
Keep talking.

1277
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,930
Go on. What happened?

1278
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:55,100
- What happened?
- Alex found out.

1279
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:58,729
- And the others haven't?
- They'd kill him if they knew.

1280
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,773
They killed Emil.

1281
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:04,276
Are you in pain?

1282
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,361
I don't know. The pills...

1283
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:08,113
Give me your feet.

1284
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:13,327
Say it again. It keeps me awake.

1285
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,911
I love you.

1286
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:19,207
Stand up. Stand up.

1287
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:21,251
Come on, wake up! Talk!

1288
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:23,712
Dr. Anderson...

1289
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:27,132
Go on. Go on, walk. Talk.

1290
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:32,179
The sand comes
from the Aymores mountains.

1291
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:33,889
We'll find it.

1292
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:37,017
Near a town, Santa Ma something.

1293
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:39,186
Good girl. We'll take care of it later.

1294
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:41,396
- Come on. Keep awake. Keep walking.
- I'm afraid.

1295
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:44,733
Dev, I'm afraid. They're all
in the house. We can't make it.

1296
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,618
Don't ever leave me.

1297
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,995
You'll never get rid of me again.

1298
01:37:58,206 --> 01:38:00,207
I never tried to.

1299
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:02,793
Brace up. Here he comes.

1300
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,134
What are you doing, Alicia?
What is this, Mr. Devlin?

1301
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,970
I'm taking her to the hospital
to get the poison out of her.

1302
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:15,347
Poison?

1303
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:17,516
How would you like
your friends downstairs to know?

1304
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:18,725
They've yet to be told.

1305
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,519
- I'm taking her back to her room.
- No, Dev.

1306
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:22,604
I'll raise quite a rumpus if you try.

1307
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:27,067
- Alex, he knows?
- Yes.

1308
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:29,152
What is happening, Alex?

1309
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:31,738
Alicia.

1310
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,241
- She's worse?
- Yes.

1311
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,452
All right, dear, we're going.
We're going.

1312
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,831
You haven't forgotten what they did
to Emil, have you, Sebastian?

1313
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:45,877
Help him, Alex.

1314
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:49,381
I'm glad you have a head on you, madame.

1315
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:50,841
I'm not afraid to die.

1316
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:55,762
You've got your chance, here and now.
Tell them who she is.

1317
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,306
Need any help, Alex?

1318
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:00,892
No, we can handle her.

1319
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,019
Where are you taking her?

1320
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:06,523
You answer that one, Sebastian.

1321
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:08,233
To the hospital.

1322
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,861
Alex, talk to them, quick!

1323
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,742
I'm glad she's going.

1324
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,911
You should not have waited
so long, Alex.

1325
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,958
Well, what am I going to do?
Start shooting?

1326
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:29,337
Hold on, darling.
You've only got about 20 yards to go.

1327
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:30,630
What happened, Alex?

1328
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,340
Hmm?

1329
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:36,052
Oh. Um...

1330
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,512
She collapsed.

1331
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:41,641
Mr. Devlin heard her scream
when he was waiting for me.

1332
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:42,809
Come on, Alicia.

1333
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:45,687
Yes. I telephoned the hospital
as soon as I saw how she was.

1334
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,731
- You have a car, Mr. Devlin?
- Out in front.

1335
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:48,940
Your hat, Alex.

1336
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:53,778
- You are going with him, madame?
- No. Alex will call me up.

1337
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:54,946
I'll wait here.

1338
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,616
Call as soon as the doctor sees her.

1339
01:39:57,783 --> 01:39:59,242
Poor child.

1340
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:04,706
- How do you feel?
- A bit dizzy.

1341
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:06,124
Take some deep breaths.

1342
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:07,626
Hurry. Hurry.

1343
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:20,222
Now, just a minute,
I must sit with her.

1344
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:21,681
No room, Sebastian.

1345
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:24,267
- You must take me, they're watching me.
- That's your headache.

1346
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:27,145
Please, take me! Please! Please!

1347
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:32,692
There is no telephone in her room
to call the hospital.

1348
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:36,321
Alex, will you come in, please?

1349
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:38,365
I wish to talk to you.
