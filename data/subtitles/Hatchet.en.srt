1
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,040
Come on, Pa. We've been
out here over three hours.

2
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,005
I mean, we don't even know
where the hell she went.

3
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,657
She's at least...

4
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,787
a 12-footer
if I ever saw one.

5
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:08,101
No, I ain't leavin' here
without her.

6
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,554
Man, I'm cold.

7
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,406
Shh.

8
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,037
Shut your hole.

9
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,469
Come on, man.
Can we pull over?

10
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,905
I gotta take
a piss.

11
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,083
Go off the side
of the boat.

12
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,616
Come on.

13
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:42,220
We ain't beachin' it.

14
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,648
Shit.

15
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,069
Jesus Christ.

16
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:03,312
Oh, come on, man.
I can't go like this.

17
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:05,047
Why in the hell not?

18
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:06,338
Well, 'cause it's weird

19
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,910
with you sittin' there
like that.

20
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,322
Just keep it down,
would ya?

21
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:10,773
See, no matter
what I say,

22
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,023
it's,
"Shut up, Ainsley,"

23
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,797
or, "You're queer,
Ainsley,"

24
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,653
or, "Why can't you be more
like your sister, Ainsley?"

25
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,106
I said shut up,
you little queer.

26
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,153
See?

27
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:19,525
See that?

28
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:22,710
Asshole.

29
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,147
What'd you say, boy?

30
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,882
Nothin'.

31
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,018
Now, don't make me throw
you in the swamp, now.

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,729
Yeah, you go-

33
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:37,241
Jesus Christ!

34
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:39,044
Jesus, son, what happened?

35
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,375
She tried to bite
my sack off!

36
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,973
You let her get away,
you moron!

37
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:52,836
Well, what the hell
was I supposed to do?

38
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,691
For crying out loud,
can we just pull over,

39
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,232
so I can finish
my damn piss?

40
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,079
Lord!

41
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:07,920
Y'all hurry up now.

42
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,849
Goddamn queer's
gotta squat to take a leak.

43
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:30,804
Oh, shit.

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,384
Keep still, Ainsley.

45
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:42,809
I think she's back.

46
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,547
Well, what should I do?

47
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,336
Don't make a sound.

48
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,358
Stay right there.

49
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:02,211
Pa?

50
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,325
Did you get her?

51
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,953
Pa?

52
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,036
Maybe we can go home now?

53
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:27,434
Pa?

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,456
Huh?

55
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,469
Pa?

56
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,328
Pa?

57
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:44,856
Pa?

58
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:55,972
Come on!

59
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,801
Come and get it,
you bitch!

60
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,368
I'll kill you!

61
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:05,956
Oh, God!

62
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,256
It hurts!

63
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,611
Oh, God!

64
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:27,905
Help me!

65
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,760
I need some beads.

66
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:24,871
Cheer up, man. This is
Mardi Gras. This is fun.

67
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,923
And I'm having a blast.

68
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:29,016
Oh, oh, right here, right
here, right here. Look at that.

69
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,994
Oh! Look at those boobs
right there.

70
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,845
Hey!
Hey.

71
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,696
They're somethin'
new, right?

72
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,305
Haven't you seen
enough boobs?

73
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,377
I'm just not feelin' this.
I- I shoulda stayed at home.

74
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,590
What, so you could sit in your
room and cry about Heather?

75
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,038
Christine.

76
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,097
Man, man. We came down here
to have a good time.

77
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,913
You? You're fighting it.
There's fun all around you.

78
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,322
Stop standing there
like a bitch.

79
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,851
How is this fun?

80
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:56,380
This place is disgusting.

81
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:59,842
Our hotel room smells
like sweaty balls, man.

82
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:02,095
Everybody's just drunk
and looking for a fight.

83
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:05,193
You! You threw up six times
yesterday. How do you even do that?

84
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,125
You guys just stay
and have fun, all right?

85
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,654
I'm gonna go find
something to do.

86
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,666
What, by yourself?

87
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,725
DeWitt and Robinson told me about
this haunted swamp tour thing

88
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,979
that they did last year;
they said it was amazing.

89
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,405
You see all these, like, floating
lights and stuff on the water. Just-

90
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:24,268
You wanna leave all of this to go
look at some damn lights in a swamp?

91
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,481
You don't have to
come with me, Marcus.

92
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,253
Look, I'll see you guys
back at the hotel.

93
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:28,816
Cool.

94
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,009
Man, wait up, wait up.
Wait up, man. I'll go-

95
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,699
Marcus, no,
go ahead and-

96
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,469
No, no, no. I'm goin'
with you. It's cool.

97
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:45,919
Thanks, man.

98
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,293
Buddy, you're gonna be
so psyched you did this.

99
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:50,144
I think I'd rather
skin my own dick.

100
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:57,387
Right. It's official.
Here it is.

101
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,681
No more chicks.

102
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,371
They're closed.

103
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,343
No. They can't
be closed.

104
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:06,241
But indeed they are. There's
a big "Closed" sign and it's-

105
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:09,219
You're still knocking.
All right, this sucks.

106
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,667
It doesn't suck.
It's gonna be cool.

107
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,012
For you,
'cause you suck.

108
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:13,861
Shut up!

109
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:19,000
What do you want?

110
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:22,803
Uh... we wanted to do
a haunted swamp tour.

111
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,988
I don't do
night tours anymore.

112
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,052
I'm not allowed to.

113
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:31,908
Okay, it's just that our friends told
us that you did one here last year.

114
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:35,508
I can't do
night tours anymore.

115
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,757
Insurance got too high...
after what happened.

116
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,480
- Too bad. Let's roll.
- W-w-w-w-wait.

117
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:46,271
Uh, what happened?

118
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:49,265
Oh, you don't want
to know.

119
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,693
I so do.

120
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,757
Here we go.

121
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:58,289
I led a tour group
out in the swamp

122
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,676
last Halloween.

123
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:02,860
It was the midst of night.

124
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,155
Yeah?

125
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:06,098
And there was this kid

126
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,173
who looked kinda like you.

127
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:11,357
He got spooked by
something in the marsh.

128
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:17,144
He saw two eyes staring
at him from the woods.

129
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,248
Chilled him to
his very marrow.

130
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:22,971
He wanted to get
off the boat in a hurry.

131
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:25,236
And he had his foot

132
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,959
dangling over the edge.
He-

133
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,497
He fell in?
A gator got him?

134
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:31,832
What happened?

135
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,947
He slipped,

136
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:38,185
hit his head
right on the roof,

137
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:41,745
and sued me for negligence!

138
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:43,040
That cocksucker!

139
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,063
That's it?

140
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:50,039
- Try Marie Laveau.
- Excuse me?

141
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,560
Two blocks east
on Olive Street.

142
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,069
But you didn't
hear it from me.

143
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,722
I have to go tend
to my birds.

144
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,536
Be careful walking
on the sidewalk.

145
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,819
Wh-whoa, come on,
man, wait.

146
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,144
What?

147
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:15,409
It's dead as hell
down there, right?

148
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,577
Fun party...
bad badness.

149
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:21,681
Wait! Ben,
this is so lame!

150
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:23,744
How is this gonna help
you get over her?

151
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:27,467
Marcus, this whole scene
back here, it's just-

152
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:31,229
Every hot, half-naked chick
I see reminds me of Christine.

153
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:34,791
Y'know? Probably gettin'
banged by that Bulkowski guy,

154
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:39,363
in her living room, bent over that
beige loveseat that my mom bought her.

155
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,940
What happened to dating
a normal guy?

156
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,489
That guy's got a neck
the size of a truck.

157
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,796
And that whole cauliflower
ear? That's weird.

158
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,657
What, is he gonna wrestle
her to submission?

159
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:50,045
- All right, stop stop stop, that's it.
- All right, okay.

160
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,825
I don't wanna think about
Bulkowski bangin' your girl anymore.

161
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,321
I don't either.
I get it.

162
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:54,981
Come on, man, this
is gonna be fun.

163
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,900
Guess there ain't no chicks at
the swamp. Won't be needin' these.

164
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,963
It'll be fun.

165
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,906
- 'Bout as fun as crabs.
- You would know.

166
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:07,726
Screw that waitress
from Fezziwig's, man.

167
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,345
You did.

168
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:11,165
I didn't know she had
bugs in her bush.

169
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,108
She was scratchin'
herself all night.

170
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,252
What do you mean,
you didn't know?

171
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,276
You can't hook up with itchy
chicks, Marcus. Everybody knows that.

172
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:20,350
She said it was a reaction
to her fabric softener, okay?

173
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,293
All right?
I saw it, I asked.

174
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:25,004
Fabric softener. Look
at you, mister big shot.

175
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,269
"Everyone knows that." When's
the last time you got laid?

176
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:32,975
- I have sex all the-
- Shut up.

177
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,009
Ladies.

178
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,702
- This is really fun.
- Whoo!

179
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:02,876
Whoa.

180
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:04,899
That's good.
Good. Uh...

181
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,287
Uh... um...

182
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:07,934
Give us a kiss?

183
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,332
Ooh, yes.

184
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,911
Yeah, you love it.

185
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:17,361
You want it.
You need it.

186
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:21,448
Oh, damn, I-I gotta
change batteries.

187
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:23,997
God. Brush
your teeth much?

188
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,453
Lick me, bitch.

189
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,720
No thanks, I like my tongue
without the syphilis.

190
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:30,795
You're syphilis,
miss big words.

191
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,020
Okay, that didn't
even make sense.

192
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:35,408
Lick me.
Misty, Jenna...

193
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,430
you can get along for a
couple more hours, can't ya?

194
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:40,776
Seriously, Doug? I can't
work with that.

195
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,980
I'm a professional actress.
I went to NYU.

196
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,637
What's so funny?

197
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:50,395
Like anybody's ever
even heard of that.

198
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,084
- New York University?
- Never heard of it.

199
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:55,742
Girls, girls, nobody ever got
discovered by being difficult, huh?

200
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:59,223
I mean, I-I-I need you guys
to show me the love, all right?

201
00:14:59,258 --> 00:14:59,476
Fine.

202
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:01,392
I need to feel the
passion here, all right?

203
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,476
We're rolling.

204
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,831
All right. I need
to feel the passion.

205
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,260
We're rolling.

206
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:08,655
All right.
You're sensuous...

207
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,448
You're playful.

208
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,458
You're curious.

209
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,144
Hmm.

210
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,795
You're smitten.

211
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,774
Who's ready to do
some hauntin', huh?

212
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:30,667
Hahaha. The night will
soon be upon us.

213
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:33,324
The spirits of the damned
are on the rise.

214
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,946
Let's get our souls
on the move, my friends!

215
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:39,694
What can I do
you two for?

216
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:42,115
Do you do
a haunted swamp tour?

217
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,387
Why, I do the only
haunted swamp tour!

218
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,420
Real, live ghosts.

219
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:50,639
Whoo. Tales of the macabre.

220
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:56,274
And actual sites that are
still damned by voodoo curses.

221
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,820
I hate you.
Oh!

222
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,529
Leaving right now,
40 bones each.

223
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:05,319
- Forty dollars?
- Yes.

224
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,069
All right.
Will you spot me?

225
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:08,749
Why? You don't
have any cash?

226
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,398
No, I'm just not paying
for this bullshit.

227
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:14,837
I know, darling.
Hello.

228
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:16,048
Hi.

229
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:18,837
Hi there.

230
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,142
How are you doin'?

231
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:22,504
Oh, my.

232
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,893
Oh, hey.

233
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,474
You mind if
I sit here?

234
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:31,836
Be my guest.

235
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,501
Hello.

236
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,816
Hey.
Oh, hi.

237
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:51,156
Uh... so... I guess
I'm sitting here.

238
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,364
I'm Ben.

239
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,170
Marybeth.

240
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:11,400
Marybeth. That's
a great name.

241
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:14,375
'Cause it's actually
two names, you know.

242
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:19,605
Most people just have one,
and that's kinda boring.

243
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,000
Ben.
But Marybeth, it's-

244
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:27,222
you know, it's Mary
and it's, uh, Beth.

245
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:28,231
That's a nice coat.

246
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,798
So do you have
any pets or-

247
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:42,254
Are you enjoying
Mardi Gras?

248
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,489
Yep.

249
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:48,056
Couldn't find anyone brave enough
to do the ghost tour with you, huh?

250
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,987
Nope.

251
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:53,166
Right on.
Right on.

252
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:55,169
Some buddies of mine back
home went on this tour-

253
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,848
Look, I'm sorry.

254
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:59,052
I didn't come on this tour
'cause I was hoping

255
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,541
that just maybe
I'd get to meet you.

256
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:03,961
If you don't mind,
I'd like to just sit

257
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:07,477
and stare out this window
and get my $30 worth, okay?

258
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:15,900
Hey, what the fuck?

259
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,764
Okay, folks, I am
your tour guide, Shawn.

260
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,744
Just sit back and get
ready to enjoy-

261
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,117
Uh, dawg? You don't
need that thing.

262
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,299
It's, like, the size
of a Mini Cooper.

263
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:56,573
Hahaha. See who laughs,
eh, pukai?

264
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,937
Like a Mini Cooper limo,
you know what I mean?

265
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:03,320
That's what I'm
talkin' about.

266
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:05,018
- I'm-
- I-

267
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,129
- Oh, no, you-
- We-

268
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,280
We are so cute
when we do that!

269
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,775
- I'm Marcus.
- Jenna.

270
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,947
Hello there.

271
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:15,079
Jim Permatteo.

272
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:19,038
And this here's
the missus, Shannon.

273
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,251
How do you do?

274
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,028
Doug Shapiro.
Nice to meet you.

275
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,119
Nice camera.

276
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,008
Makin' a movie?

277
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:26,635
Yeah.

278
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,493
Well, what do
you know, lovekins?

279
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,998
We've got ourselves
a director over here.

280
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:34,554
How exciting. What kind
of movie is it?

281
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,858
<i>Well, have you ever heard
of Bayou Beavers?</i>

282
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,433
- Sure. No.
- No.

283
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:40,413
Okay, everyone.
If you take a look

284
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,948
out your right side,
you'll see

285
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,736
the legendary Saint Louis
Cemetery Number One,

286
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:48,212
uh, founded in
178, uh, 9,

287
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,484
this here's the resting place of
the first black mayor of New Orleans,

288
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,626
Ernest Morial.

289
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,211
It is also believed
to be the burial site

290
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,514
of the infamous
voodoo queen Marie Laveau.

291
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,292
Haha, yes, sir.

292
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:03,565
Now, y'all notice how we bury
our dead above the ground?

293
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:06,192
Well, that's because of all the
voodoo curses in the air down here.

294
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:08,172
The dead have a tendency
to rise out of the dirt,

295
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,080
so we like to keep 'em
cemented in instead.

296
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:14,919
Shawn, excuse me, but we heard that
the reason you bury them above ground

297
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,778
is because of
the water level.

298
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,758
- Oh, no.
- That's right.

299
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,909
The water level is so high that
sometimes things in the ground

300
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,132
will rise back up
to the surface.

301
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,273
No, that's not why.
But we heard-

302
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:28,900
<i>I said no!</i>

303
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:41,829
All right,
time's wasting.

304
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,283
Everyone onboard.

305
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:46,396
Scary bus to scary boat.

306
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:48,294
- Everyone.
- Watch your step, lovekins.

307
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:53,143
All right, all right,
heh heh heh heh.

308
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:58,073
Hey there, hey there, all right.
No time- No time for dilly-dallying.

309
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:59,930
Gotta beat the rush.
That's right.

310
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:08,255
All right, all right,
comin' through.

311
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,628
Okay, gotta go, gotta go.

312
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:19,204
Dude.

313
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:22,719
That's the boat?

314
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,154
Okay, let's, uh,
see something, girls.

315
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:28,578
Whoo!

316
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,468
Okay, you're silly.

317
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:32,458
You're tough.

318
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,478
You're cute.

319
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,498
You've got a secret.

320
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,192
Come on, lovekins.

321
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:45,872
- Look like she's old
enough to be in porn-

322
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:48,458
Oh!

323
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,519
That's it, all aboard.

324
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:54,559
All right, here we go.

325
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:58,923
Hey! You there!

326
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,630
Hello!

327
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,742
Mr. Shawn, I think that man's
trying to talk to you.

328
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:06,923
Oh, no, no, no.
Heh heh.

329
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:10,438
Hey! Where ya think you're goin'?

330
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,297
What's he saying?

331
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:16,136
Oh, that guy? Don't mind him.
That's just Jack Cracker.

332
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:18,116
Jack Cracker?

333
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:20,580
Yeah, yeah, one of the local
alligator hunters.

334
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:22,197
Just sits there,
yells things.

335
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:24,258
Drinks his own piss.

336
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,550
He's, you know,
cracked.

337
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,409
Come on.

338
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,591
This swamp is closed!

339
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:36,177
Hey! The swamp is-

340
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,884
Victor Crowley!

341
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,258
What's he saying?

342
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:47,248
Okay, okay, okay, here we go.
Everybody wave bye-bye to Jack.

343
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,349
- Everybody wave bye-bye to Jack.
- Whoo!

344
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,622
Bye, Jack! Bye, Mr. Cracker!

345
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:53,794
Bye-bye!

346
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:03,613
You're all gonna die.

347
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,987
Oh, yeah. That's good.

348
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:20,220
Remember, you don't
need to keep

349
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:22,240
all your fingers
and toes onboard,

350
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:23,492
just the ones
you want to keep.

351
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:25,715
Heh heh heh. That's right.

352
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,584
There's big alligators
in these here waters.

353
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:30,644
Hey, now, check it out.
Off to the left,

354
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,907
you'll see something you don't
see every day, but I do.

355
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:36,625
Heh heh. Real live
cypress tress.

356
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:39,776
Now here, what did the Spanish
moss say to the cypress?

357
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:43,089
"Mind if I hang around?"
Heh heh heh.

358
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,797
<i>You know, sometimes I'll tell
that joke in español.</i>

359
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:48,544
Hey there, isn't
the cypress the Louisiana state tree?

360
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:50,080
I bet it sure is.

361
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,261
Yeah, since 1963,
the bald cypress.

362
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:54,726
Oh, now, only room
for one guide

363
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,908
on this boat now. Heh heh.

364
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,565
Now, we're gonna move
into a part of the swamp

365
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,666
with the scary ghosts, y'all.

366
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,211
I need everyone to be
overenthusiastic,

367
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:06,161
or you'll wind up
overboard.

368
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:14,363
Now, here on
the Mississippi Bayou,

369
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:18,242
hundreds of fishermen and old
pirates have lost their lives.

370
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:20,182
And if we're lucky, we might
be able to see their souls

371
00:24:20,183 --> 00:24:23,009
floating over the waters
where they up and died.

372
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,040
- Now, you all should feel very safe.
- This is beat.

373
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,980
Come on, man, give it
a break. This is fun.

374
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:29,758
'Bout as fun
as a bag of dicks.

375
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,818
This is beat as hell.

376
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,444
Only thing scary is
Uncle Remus meets Bruce Lee.

377
00:24:34,446 --> 00:24:36,910
<i>Feel like I'm in Enter the
Song of the South or some shit.</i>

378
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,646
What about your
new girlie here, huh?

379
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:42,082
She all right.

380
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,939
But it's not like I'm pulling
the ass on this stupid boat.

381
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,930
Okay, so lay the groundwork,
set it up for later.

382
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:48,506
Like you and
what's-her-face?

383
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,486
"That's a nice coat."

384
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,668
That was classic.

385
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,991
About as classic as-
It's about as classic as-

386
00:24:56,992 --> 00:24:59,011
- I got nothin'.
- Exactly.

387
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:08,385
Now, comin' up, you'll all see a
old house with a barn behind it.

388
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:11,942
That right there is the home of
a real famous Louisiana legend,

389
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,325
Victor Crowley.
Hatchet Face.

390
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:17,759
The legend is, is that
he was a deformed man

391
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,961
whose own father went nuts and whacked
him in the face with a hatchet one night.

392
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:26,244
Probably on account of he
was so ugly or something.

393
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:28,871
Anyway, he died.

394
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:33,154
And so the story goes is that if you're ever
near the old Crowley house late at night,

395
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:37,033
you'll still hear old Victor
Crowley cryin' for his daddy.

396
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:45,073
Daddy.
- Y'all hear that?

397
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:46,650
Hmm.

398
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:49,559
Daddy!

399
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,731
I done heard it again!

400
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:52,589
That ain't the story.

401
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,529
That's the gist
of it, anyway.

402
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,711
It's not even the house.

403
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:58,165
Christ! Would you just
let me do my job?

404
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,327
Y'all try
the crawfish yet?

405
00:26:06,328 --> 00:26:09,358
I'm so psyched
I did this.

406
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,580
That fade you had
in high school.

407
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:11,820
What?

408
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,963
It's about as classic
as that fade you had-

409
00:26:13,964 --> 00:26:15,135
- Too late.
- What?

410
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:16,954
You still on classic?

411
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:19,540
Are y'all ready to see
something really scary?

412
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,601
Huh? Are y'all ready?

413
00:26:21,602 --> 00:26:23,216
Everyone who's ready
say, "Oh, yeah".

414
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:28,146
Okay, I'm gonna do it anyway.
Here we go.

415
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:31,378
Okay, folks, I'm gonna shut
the lights off for a second.

416
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:38,006
Once your eyes adjust, you'll be
able to see some of the ghost lights,

417
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,914
just hovering above the water
over to the right at Kwaj Island.

418
00:26:47,097 --> 00:26:48,429
I don't see anything.

419
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:50,652
Uh, wait till
your eyes adjust.

420
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:53,157
They're adjusted, there's
just nothing there.

421
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,531
Hey, can we get those
lights going again?

422
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:55,986
You're killing all
my camera shots.

423
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:02,087
Jim, look! I think
I see something.

424
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,552
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, you see?

425
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:07,622
Not one but two ghosts!
Yeah, I told y'all.

426
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:10,653
Isn't that just a chemical reaction
from the water and the gases?

427
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,633
No, no, no, man! It's-
They're ghosts! Look!

428
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:17,966
Nah, bra. Those are marsh
vapors. I've seen this on TV.

429
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:23,017
Hell, man, why'd you all
come, then? They're ghosts!

430
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,269
Oh, you're right.

431
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:27,947
Except no.

432
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,704
Damn it.

433
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:40,513
Now, uh, that's the spot
where Captain John Donovan

434
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:44,675
supposedly buried
a trunk full a treasure.

435
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:48,514
Legend says, though, that he left
two of his crew behind to guard it,

436
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:51,018
but he cut off their legs
so they couldn't run away.

437
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:54,251
That's a stupid story.

438
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,463
Fine.

439
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:59,180
Jim, did you see that?

440
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:01,362
I did. What was that?

441
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:05,564
Oh, it could- it c-could be
one of the more active spirits

442
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,544
we sometimes get
after it rains.

443
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:10,049
Hoo hoo hoo, it's spooky,
isn't it, folks? Hahaha.

444
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:14,575
Okay, perfect.
Perfect.

445
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:16,959
Hey, who wants to be in
the Halloween video?

446
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,373
- Ugh.
- Come on, girls.

447
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:27,868
Whoo!

448
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:31,828
Okay, your "Whoo" is
so not in the moment.

449
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:32,596
Yeah? Well, your
nipples are dumb. Ugh.

450
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:36,757
This is pretty cool.

451
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,525
It's cold.

452
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:43,061
Not much of
a talker, are you?

453
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:44,151
I ain't here
to make friends.

454
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,890
Friends. Nice.
Must be a local.

455
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:52,677
I just didn't know that
locals did this touristy stuff.

456
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,707
- We don't.
- No, of course. Yeah. No.

457
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,496
Yeah, I wouldn't really
do it either, normally.

458
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:03,182
It's just buddies of mine from college
told me about it and said it was cool, so...

459
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:05,728
I figured what
the hell, you know?

460
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:09,284
Check out the swamp.
Enjoy the activity.

461
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:11,789
I'm gonna be honest
with you right now.

462
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,667
I, uh, just got dumped by my
girlfriend of eight years,

463
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:19,103
and, uh, my friends took me down
here to try to get my mind off of it,

464
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:21,446
but, you know, I-

465
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,547
We were together since
the seventh grade May Dance,

466
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:26,416
and, you know, she tells
me she needs space.

467
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:29,689
What does that even mean
in girl language?

468
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,467
Space.

469
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,365
Whatever.

470
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:37,365
Get my mind off of it.
Just relax.

471
00:29:37,366 --> 00:29:38,700
- Jesus!
- Drive much?

472
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,902
What happened?

473
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:46,497
Oh, we just...
got stuck.

474
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:48,437
Stuck? On what?

475
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,699
Oh, on some rocks or something.
I don't know.

476
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,811
Uh, here. Someone-
Someone give me a hand.

477
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:00,396
Here. Help me push
the boat off.

478
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,195
Is this a part
of every tour?

479
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:08,155
Relax. It's all good.

480
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:15,791
All part of the tour!

481
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:21,973
Damn it!

482
00:30:21,975 --> 00:30:23,751
Who are you
gonna call, Daddy?

483
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:25,530
Shut up,
you nasty bitch!

484
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:28,115
I would call the police
and they'd send someone.

485
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:30,701
- Who?
- The cops. Duh.

486
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:34,136
The police are gonna
send the cops.

487
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:35,509
They're the same thing!

488
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:37,287
No, they're not!
There's a difference.

489
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:38,904
- Nuh-uh.
- Yuh-huh.

490
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,884
Whoa, whoa, ladies, ladies,
I'll get us unstuck.

491
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:43,187
No need to be
calling The Man.

492
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,004
Marcus,
little help maybe?

493
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:49,611
- This sucks.
- My hair!

494
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:51,833
They're half our age
and they're all of them complaining,

495
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,894
every single one of them.

496
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,430
You just sit right
back down over here.

497
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,733
Not very familiar with
your stories yet, huh?

498
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,874
Shawn, how many of these
tours have you done?

499
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:13,894
Oh, I-I-I've
done a bunch.

500
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:16,602
Oh, Jim, this is
a fine how-do-you-do.

501
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:19,107
Ew! My feet are
getting wet.

502
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:26,460
Are we sinking?

503
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:28,158
No! No, we're
not sinking.

504
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,370
It certainly looks like
it now, doesn't it?

505
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,724
Everyone calm down!

506
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:40,159
Th-this tree that we're stuck
on goes all the way to the shore.

507
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,421
Maybe there's a road
or a phone or something.

508
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:45,129
Oh, out here in
the middle of nowhere?

509
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,432
Well, we can't
stay here.

510
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:50,987
No, no, no, Jim, I think we
should stay here and wait for help.

511
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:54,300
There's gotta be another tour
boat coming through soon, right?

512
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:59,756
Probably not. It's
raining pretty bad.

513
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:04,765
Lovekins, we can walk right
across this tree to the shore.

514
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,382
No, no, it looks dangerous.

515
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,402
Damn. I could
be at a bar.

516
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:09,695
You are not gonna- No!

517
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,675
Here, watch me.

518
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:15,433
Oh, oh, Jim, wait!

519
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:20,565
It's okay, don't
worry about it.

520
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,787
Honey, come
back here!

521
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:25,736
Okay, it's a little slippery,
so you have to watch your step.

522
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:28,160
But I think-

523
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:29,171
Oh!

524
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,988
Someone help me!

525
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,010
- Do something! Do something!
- He's got my leg!

526
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:40,686
Oh, God, it's gonna
take my leg off!

527
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:46,221
Get him to the shore!

528
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:49,090
With his blood in the water, this whole
place is gonna be a feeding frenzy.

529
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,111
Move!

530
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:56,970
Come on, everyone off the boat.
It's sinking.

531
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:58,586
No way! I'm not
going out there!

532
00:32:58,588 --> 00:32:59,273
Oh, you're going
out there.

533
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:09,294
- Jim! Is Jim all right?
- He's fine. He's okay.

534
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:14,587
Put your weight
on your left leg.

535
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:17,779
- Okay.
- Jim!

536
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,698
No, don't cry,
don't worry.

537
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,961
It's all right, all
right? Just come on, I got you.

538
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:24,850
Shh. Don't worry,
don't worry.

539
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:31,839
Come on. Stand up!

540
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:33,900
I can't!

541
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:36,325
Honey, you need to stand up.
It's safer the higher up you get.

542
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:36,931
I don't want to.

543
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:41,254
Come on, I got you.

544
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:43,760
- Stand up!
- I can't!

545
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:46,022
Misty! Mist!
Look at me. Look at me.

546
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,679
You're gonna be fine.
Just walk across.

547
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,710
Come on, I got you.

548
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:52,648
Come on! Walk across.
We don't have time.

549
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:58,790
Come on!
Hurry up!

550
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:06,023
Whoa!

551
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:10,549
Come on! Get out
of the water!

552
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,053
Get out of the water!

553
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:15,356
Get out of the water!

554
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:17,660
God!

555
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:21,822
Where'd it go?

556
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:24,529
What was that?

557
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,307
Run!

558
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,408
Go, go, go!

559
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:52,045
- Good going, jackass!
- Hey, screw you!

560
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,066
You guys, we need to get
out of these woods.

561
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,691
Gators can walk
on land, too. Go!

562
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:58,026
But my hat!

563
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,541
Stop!

564
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,076
Slow down.
Don't hurt yourself.

565
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:13,621
You all right?

566
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:15,965
Oh, oh, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

567
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:19,278
Right here, right here.

568
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:21,057
Oh, my gosh!

569
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,895
Does somebody wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

570
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:35,966
Does someone wanna explain
why Janie's got a gun?

571
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,502
Yeah, why do you
have a gun?

572
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:40,007
Oh, why should I tell you,
you little con artist?

573
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,309
Huh?

574
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,775
Okay, okay, look.

575
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,189
I'm gonna be honest.

576
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,048
I just moved down
here from Detroit.

577
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:50,310
My brother, he hooked me up
with this touristy gig,

578
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,896
told me I could make a ton
of dough, so I say try it out.

579
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:55,765
How many tours
have you done?

580
00:35:55,766 --> 00:35:57,057
More importantly, how many
boats you ever driven?

581
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,037
Look, I did the one tour
last night.

582
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:02,068
I did this one
here tonight, all right?

583
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:03,402
The boat didn't
sink last night!

584
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:05,826
I can't believe this.

585
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:08,048
What the hell
does she have a gun for?

586
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,665
That's what I
want to know.

587
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:13,503
Because I'm lookin'
for another boat, okay?

588
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,250
My daddy and my brother went out
hunting on this river two nights ago

589
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,594
and they never came back.

590
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,735
The cops said they're probably just
off on a bender or something somewhere,

591
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:22,675
but I know that isn't
what happened.

592
00:36:22,676 --> 00:36:26,675
So you go on a ghost tour?
How does that make any sense?

593
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:29,180
30 bucks for a boat ride
was a hell of a lot cheaper

594
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:30,554
than gettin'
my own boat, wasn't it?

595
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,817
That still doesn't
explain the gun.

596
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,322
Yeah, and why her ticket
was only 30 bucks.

597
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:39,403
I have a gun because
these woods aren't safe.

598
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:41,625
Besides, it just
saved his life.

599
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:44,857
Stop it! My husband needs help.

600
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:48,373
Look, we need to get him help and
we need to get outta these woods.

601
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,111
Who made you the leader?

602
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:52,817
We should call for help
and stay right here.

603
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:55,969
No bars.
I hate the south!

604
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,342
I don't think we should
move him right now.

605
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:59,525
- Well, we have to!
- He's bleeding

606
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:01,667
pretty badly; we can't
carry him all the way home.

607
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:03,484
If we don't get out
of these woods right now,

608
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:04,212
we're all gonna die.

609
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:08,696
What are you talking about?

610
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,021
These are his woods.

611
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,354
Whose woods?

612
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:15,848
Victor Crowley.

613
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:18,556
Enough with
the stories already, huh?

614
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:22,030
Y'all don't even
know where you are.

615
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,222
- I already told you that-
- All right, shut up.

616
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,476
Okay? You're not
even from here.

617
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:31,203
Where are we?

618
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:34,556
It was like
a dirty secret.

619
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:40,133
<i>Victor Crowley was born
horribly disfigured.</i>

620
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,678
<i>His daddy kept him
hidden away in his house,</i>

621
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,930
<i>where no one
would see him.</i>

622
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:50,840
<i>They lived
like that for years,</i>

623
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:51,890
<i>just keepin'
to themselves,</i>

624
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,385
<i>alone.</i>

625
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,246
<i>Victor was scared
to death of other kids.</i>

626
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:36,862
<i>They teased him
and tortured him,</i>

627
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:39,043
<i>like kids do.</i>

628
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:41,832
<i>They were so cruel.</i>

629
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,479
<i>And then, years later,
on Halloween night,</i>

630
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,500
<i>some teenagers came
to the house.</i>

631
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,681
<i>They were tryin' to
get a look at him,</i>

632
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:55,772
<i>tryin' to scare him
out of the house.</i>

633
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:28,784
<i>Mr. Crowley got home, and he
tried and tried to get inside,</i>

634
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:32,864
<i>but the door was on fire.</i>

635
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:35,773
<i>He could hear Victor screaming
inside, but he couldn't get in.</i>

636
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:43,411
<i>So he ran and got himself a hatchet,
and he started chopping at that door.</i>

637
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:47,168
<i>But Victor was pressed up against
the other side, trying to get out.</i>

638
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:54,886
<i>And it was an accident, but he hit
him in the face with that hatchet,</i>

639
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:56,663
<i>and poor Victor Crowley died.</i>

640
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:03,653
<i>The old man became
a recluse after that.</i>

641
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,512
<i>He never
left his house,</i>

642
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:07,128
<i>just sat there
for almost ten years,</i>

643
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,755
<i>before he finally died
of a broken heart.</i>

644
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:24,502
And from that point on, people
started disappearing in this swamp.

645
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:27,049
All the locals
and hunters say

646
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,634
that if you get close enough
to the Crowley house at night,

647
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:33,150
you can still hear
Victor Crowley,

648
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:34,887
cryin' for his daddy
in the woods.

649
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:40,383
They say he's come back.

650
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:42,524
He wanders
the swamp at night,

651
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:45,109
with that hatchet slash
across his face.

652
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:49,191
This whole part of the river's
illegal to even be in.

653
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:51,292
It has been for years.

654
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,312
That's why there's
no other tour boats.

655
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:55,817
And that's why he
brought us this way,

656
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,524
so he wouldn't get caught
running his phony business.

657
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,222
That's why I came.

658
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:01,797
To find your father?

659
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:07,009
And my brother.

660
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,767
They started comin' down this
way to hunt gators last week.

661
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,403
Thought they'd catch more, bein'
the only boat in a closed-off swamp.

662
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:16,181
I told them
not to come.

663
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,737
So you think a ghost
got your family?

664
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:21,434
Okay, that-that
is so stupid!

665
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,939
Look around. There's
no one in these woods!

666
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,556
Yes, there is.

667
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:27,697
They probably got stuck,
just like we did,

668
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,960
and had to walk
the whole way home.

669
00:41:29,962 --> 00:41:32,304
Right now, they're probably
sittin' at a Denny's or something.

670
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:34,323
Moons Over My Hammy.

671
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,111
Besides, we are nowhere
near the Crowley house.

672
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:38,728
Okay? I already told you,

673
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,031
it's on the other side of
the river, over two miles ago.

674
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,243
That wasn't the house!

675
00:41:42,244 --> 00:41:43,658
How do you know?

676
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:44,627
Because that is.

677
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:50,728
Look, I told you all
the truth, okay?

678
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,183
I don't care
who believes it.

679
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:56,385
You are really starting
to freak me out, all right?

680
00:41:56,386 --> 00:41:57,840
I just want to go home.

681
00:41:57,841 --> 00:41:59,860
Tell me this is
part of the tour.

682
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:02,406
Oh, yeah, I sink
the boat every night.

683
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:03,457
It's hilarious.

684
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:08,992
I want my money back.

685
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,143
All right, okay. There's gotta be
a road around here or something.

686
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:15,860
Shit.

687
00:42:15,862 --> 00:42:18,003
I don't wanna
go that way.

688
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:19,416
I'm not
going that way.

689
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,032
If it's
the quickest way,

690
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:23,012
then that's the way
we're going!

691
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:25,518
Why couldn't you keep your
stories to yourself, huh?

692
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,053
We're not
in enough trouble

693
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:30,043
that you had to scare the
pants off everyone, too?

694
00:42:30,044 --> 00:42:32,831
I am trying to help you.
Y'all need to know the truth.

695
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:34,730
Baloney!

696
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:37,598
All right, all right. Just- You
help me come pick him up, all right?

697
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,306
Come on. Right
over my shoulder.

698
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,923
Get up.

699
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:43,903
Be careful, be careful.
Easy, easy.

700
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:45,397
You got him, man?

701
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:49,155
I'm right
here, Jim.

702
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,601
Here you go.
Easy, easy.

703
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:08,712
All right, everything's
gonna be just fine.

704
00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:11,741
Look, we'll get him some help
and we'll all go home.

705
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,035
Stay close to me.

706
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:18,409
You're really scared
of that story, huh?

707
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,227
I mean, look, it's just
a myth. Everybody has 'em.

708
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:22,369
Bigfoot,
Loch Ness Monster.

709
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,702
- Please stop talking.
- Okay.

710
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:32,914
I cannot believe that I
am out here in a swamp.

711
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:34,894
I bet Julia Roberts
didn't have to do this

712
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:36,308
<i>before she got
Mystic Pizza.</i>

713
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:39,218
Do you believe that
Victor Whatever story?

714
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,954
Oh, absolutely not.

715
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:43,055
I don't trust
anyone around here.

716
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:45,521
I mean, these people sleep
exclusively with their own families.

717
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:53,320
Yo, why is it that the crackers
are back there with the honeys

718
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:56,552
and we two brothers gotta
carry the injured dude?

719
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:57,885
I am so sorry.

720
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:59,946
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

721
00:43:59,947 --> 00:44:01,682
I just want
to get to a road,

722
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:03,057
then I'm gonna
whip your ass.

723
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:05,198
Jim, how you
doin', baby?

724
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,602
I'm so cold. It hurts
like a son of a gun!

725
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,219
How much further is
the road past the house?

726
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,714
I don't know.
Few miles.

727
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:21,442
A few miles?
Are you kidding me?

728
00:44:21,443 --> 00:44:25,644
Daddy.

729
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:26,735
Did you-
Shh.

730
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:33,887
Daddy.

731
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:38,210
I want to go home.

732
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:40,957
Oh!

733
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:42,210
You are all
a bunch of cowards!

734
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:45,159
Is anybody home?

735
00:44:45,161 --> 00:44:47,099
Somebody help us!

736
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,008
We need help!

737
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:54,210
Please stop. We shouldn't have gone
this way. We need to turn around.

738
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,837
And go where?
Back in the water?

739
00:44:56,838 --> 00:44:58,938
Please, just stop.

740
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:02,534
We need to
stick together.

741
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:04,393
- We need to stop him.
- Come on!

742
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:08,433
Y- Y-You can't carry him all by yourself.

743
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:11,625
I'm right here, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

744
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:12,716
We don't need
those loonies,

745
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:14,898
those cowards!

746
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:16,838
Stop! We need
to stick together.

747
00:45:18,576 --> 00:45:19,463
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

748
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,141
We have the Good Lord
with us, baby.

749
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,434
The Good Lord
will protect us.

750
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:34,818
Raahr!

751
00:45:36,072 --> 00:45:37,969
Aah!

752
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,151
Aah!

753
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:41,121
Ohh!

754
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:45,202
Oh, my God!

755
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:52,556
Come on!

756
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:53,324
Stop!

757
00:45:55,345 --> 00:45:57,768
Help us! Help us!

758
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,465
Aah!

759
00:46:12,032 --> 00:46:13,324
Aah!

760
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:32,921
Wait! Wait!

761
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,508
It's me! It's me!
It's me!

762
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:38,901
- Where is everyone?
- I don't know.

763
00:46:38,902 --> 00:46:40,437
We're over here.
What happened?

764
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:41,609
They're both dead.

765
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:47,427
- But I shot him.
- You shot him?

766
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,487
But I thought he was a ghost!
You can't shoot a ghost.

767
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:50,699
You can shoot
a ghost?

768
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,760
- Did you kill him?
- I don't know.

769
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:55,104
- He fell down.
- God, this isn't happening!

770
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:56,478
W- W-Where's Marcus?

771
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,892
Up here.

772
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,609
What are you
doing? Get down!

773
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,074
Don't- No way. No way.
I'm stayin' right here.

774
00:47:04,076 --> 00:47:06,620
This is bullshit, man,
this is fucked up.

775
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:08,437
What can you see
from up there?

776
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,620
I can see ain't no dead
Elephant Man comin' to get me.

777
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,681
Come on. Do you see
a road? Lights? Anything?

778
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:19,146
I think I see downtown,
but I don't know.

779
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:21,004
Well, how far?
What direction?

780
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,933
That way. But it's far,
way too far.

781
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:29,772
All right. Did you see a
road or cars or something?

782
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:31,308
What kind of
stupid shit, man?

783
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:32,802
It's dark, it's wet,
and I can't see shit.

784
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:36,116
Wait. Where's Shapiro?

785
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:15,673
Doug! Hey, Shapiro,
where are you?

786
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,330
Keep it down!

787
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,501
We need
to keep moving.

788
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:20,199
We can't just
leave him out here.

789
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,824
Then why don't you just
run off and go find him?

790
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:24,036
That was mean.

791
00:48:24,038 --> 00:48:25,248
Try your phone.

792
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,067
I dropped it.

793
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:28,563
You lost it?

794
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:30,825
- Moron!
- Shut up, skank.

795
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,856
Enough! He could not have
gotten very far, okay? Let's go!

796
00:48:33,857 --> 00:48:35,513
All right, Marcus,
come on, let's go.

797
00:48:35,514 --> 00:48:38,461
No way. No, I'm
stayin' right here.

798
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:40,401
No need to
panic, okay?

799
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:41,573
Just come down.
We gotta go get help.

800
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:47,311
All right. We'll send someone
for you tomorrow. Let's go.

801
00:48:47,312 --> 00:48:48,644
Wait, wait,
hold up, hold up.

802
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:51,472
I'm comin'.
Damn it.

803
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:54,664
Not even supposed to be
here right now, man.

804
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,655
Supposed to be lookin' at some
titties, man. What's wrong with us?

805
00:48:57,656 --> 00:48:59,715
Shit. How the fuck did I
get up in this goddamn tree?

806
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:07,837
God damn it, a branch
hit me in the nuts.

807
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,271
This is bullshit.

808
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:15,756
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

809
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:55,192
If you shot him,
aren't we safe now?

810
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:56,930
Maybe he's not a ghost.

811
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:00,283
Maybe- Maybe he's just some sick,
twisted backwoods hick

812
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:02,789
who, like, snapped
and went on a killing spree.

813
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,051
Yeah, and now he's dead
because she shot him.

814
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:06,707
Ugh, get
your own theories.

815
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:08,001
Oh, God.

816
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:10,021
Some backwoods hick, huh?

817
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:13,052
Who says it's not some spoiled
little city brat who went crazy

818
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,435
after doing soft-core porn
to get back at her parents?

819
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:17,617
Okay,
for your information,

820
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,273
I am from the Valley,
not the city.

821
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:21,011
Victor Crowley is real.

822
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:27,112
My mama always said
that sometimes,

823
00:50:27,113 --> 00:50:29,214
if a person dies
all traumatic-like,

824
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:32,891
then their spirit can get kind of
just stuck in the night they died.

825
00:50:32,892 --> 00:50:34,708
Like
a poltergeist?

826
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,577
Like a ghost that can
physically move things?

827
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:40,164
No, like a ghost who can
rip someone to pieces

828
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,507
right in front of you.

829
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:44,245
I just wanna get
the hell out of here.

830
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:46,185
You know what,
Jackie Tucker?

831
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:47,962
Your tour sucks my ass.

832
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:49,335
What did you just call me?

833
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,073
You heard me.
Say it again!

834
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:53,537
I'll say it all night, you
fake Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker,

835
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:55,517
"I think I hear a little Emeril,"
you confused wanna-be-

836
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,497
Why don't you just get
off my case, asshole?

837
00:50:57,499 --> 00:50:58,548
It was an accident,
for Christ's sake!

838
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,851
Okay, look.

839
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,913
I'm going to be completely and
totally honest with you guys.

840
00:51:06,914 --> 00:51:08,004
I, like-

841
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:09,377
- Ooh, shit!
- What? What?

842
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:10,266
Ah!

843
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:15,317
Marcus, come on!
Come on!

844
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:17,741
Hey, come on!
Shit!

845
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:18,993
Stop. Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

846
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:20,326
This isn't my fault,
all right?

847
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,145
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really!

848
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:23,681
What, you think
I actually believe

849
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:24,772
these stupid, lame-ass
ghost stories?

850
00:51:24,773 --> 00:51:26,266
Well,
I'm believing it now!

851
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:28,408
- Did you see that shit back there?
- Guys! Guys.

852
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,822
I bet this means
Shapiro was here.

853
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,802
What a genius.

854
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:38,024
You do know the vibrator goes in
your cooch and not your ear, right?

855
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:40,165
Hey, why don't you suck
your dad off again, bitch?

856
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,338
I will right after
you're done.

857
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:42,065
- Fine.
- Good.

858
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:46,793
All right,
anybody got a lighter?

859
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:47,843
What are you doing?

860
00:51:47,844 --> 00:51:48,732
I'll show you.

861
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:55,076
Looking for this.

862
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,834
What else do we got here?

863
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:06,632
"Samuel M. Barrett?"

864
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:07,156
What's that?

865
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:12,450
Shapiro.

866
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:13,905
It's his driver's license.

867
00:52:13,906 --> 00:52:15,238
- What?
- I don't know.

868
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,774
Samuel M. Barrett,

869
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:19,117
ten bucks, condom,
business car-

870
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:21,784
We got two sets here.

871
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:25,178
Samuel M. Barrett, Whitman
Diagnostics Senior Marketing Manager.

872
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:27,481
Doug Shapiro,
Producer/Director.

873
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,441
That asshole!

874
00:52:31,442 --> 00:52:34,229
I flew all the way down here
from New York, and he-

875
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,925
Ugh!

876
00:52:35,926 --> 00:52:38,714
<i>So he really didn't
work for Bayou Beavers?</i>

877
00:52:38,715 --> 00:52:40,168
I'm thinking no.

878
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,502
Dude must pretend
he's a producer

879
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:43,279
to get his own
little collection.

880
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,451
Good idea.

881
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,158
That pervert.

882
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:50,270
Why are all men
such slime?

883
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:51,725
I can't believe
I've fallen for that shit

884
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:53,744
three times now.

885
00:52:53,746 --> 00:52:55,966
Okay, whoa, whoa.

886
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:57,906
Anyone else have
anymore secrets?

887
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,280
Because if I find out
someone else is lying,

888
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:00,936
I swear
I'll kill you myself.

889
00:53:16,656 --> 00:53:19,119
I didn't really go to NYU.

890
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:24,695
It was my first choice,
but I didn't get in.

891
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:27,241
So I went to Hofstra.

892
00:53:27,242 --> 00:53:28,211
We don't have
time for this.

893
00:53:44,212 --> 00:53:48,010
I was moving to Hollywood
next month to be famous.

894
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:50,636
And now I'm going to die
with all you assholes!

895
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:52,414
Look, we shot him,
all right?

896
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:53,666
Nobody's going to die.

897
00:53:54,637 --> 00:53:55,929
Ah! Oh!

898
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:01,384
Will somebody
shut her up?

899
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:04,536
He's still alive.

900
00:54:04,537 --> 00:54:06,151
No, man, he looks
dead as shit.

901
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:07,526
Not him...

902
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:08,940
Crowley.

903
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,798
Okay, you only shot him,
like, once, right?

904
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:12,212
Maybe you gotta
shoot him more times.

905
00:54:12,213 --> 00:54:13,626
Like, I don't know,
four or six times.

906
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:15,364
Maybe you gotta shoot him,
like, six times!

907
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:16,737
I wanna keep moving!
Can we please keep moving?

908
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:18,233
I don't want to stay here!

909
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:20,011
We should stick to where
we can see the river,

910
00:54:20,012 --> 00:54:21,788
so we won't get more lost.

911
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,243
<i>Shh.</i>

912
00:54:23,244 --> 00:54:24,899
- Did y'all hear that?
- What?

913
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,466
It's over here.

914
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:36,658
What is that?

915
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:37,870
My cell phone!

916
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,749
We have a signal.

917
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,245
- Oh, God.
- No, no, no.

918
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,376
It's a good thing.
We can call for help.

919
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:54,840
No!

920
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:58,073
Shit, we just went
in a huge circle!

921
00:54:58,075 --> 00:54:59,325
I thought you knew
your way around here.

922
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,103
Oh, said the fucking
tour guide.

923
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:02,194
Hey, I don't want to hit you,
but you're making it-

924
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:03,406
Shut the fu-

925
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:11,892
Okay, I'm gonna go check out that
barn, see if there's a weapon.

926
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:13,387
There's gotta be something
else to fight back with.

927
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:15,044
No, you can't go back
to that house.

928
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,821
I only have a few shots left.
We need something else.

929
00:55:16,823 --> 00:55:18,155
What if it comes back?

930
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:19,730
We don't have much time.

931
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:24,337
All-
Stay here.

932
00:55:24,338 --> 00:55:26,398
- Cool.
- Cool.

933
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:27,933
Do you have signal
on that thing?

934
00:55:27,934 --> 00:55:30,761
Come on.
Go through.

935
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:32,538
We shouldn't stay here.
We gotta keep moving.

936
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,155
Look, if it was ringing,
it has to work.

937
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:37,307
Ew! Scott Barnes called me?

938
00:55:37,308 --> 00:55:39,771
What? Will you just dial?

939
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:42,196
It won't let me.

940
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:43,892
Work, God damn it.

941
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,571
I think he ate these things.

942
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,441
Aah!

943
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,219
Shh, shh, shh!
What? What?

944
00:56:56,907 --> 00:56:59,653
It's my daddy and my brother.

945
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:14,118
No...

946
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:18,240
Are you sure
the number is 911?

947
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:19,977
What else would it be,
dumbass?

948
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,512
Well, how should I know
if it's the cell?

949
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:23,574
Maybe you have to type in
a different area code.

950
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:26,038
Oh, God.

951
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:29,351
What?

952
00:57:30,808 --> 00:57:32,342
Don't move.

953
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:40,383
I said-

954
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:42,524
Sorry.

955
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:48,827
I think we should run.

956
00:57:48,828 --> 00:57:51,049
What if it's a person
and they need help?

957
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,150
We'll apologize later.

958
00:57:56,627 --> 00:57:57,798
I think there's
a kid in there.

959
00:57:57,799 --> 00:57:59,939
You're crazy.

960
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,242
If it was that monster,
we'd already be dead.

961
00:58:02,243 --> 00:58:05,029
Screw this.

962
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:06,888
What is that?

963
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,332
Aw, hell, no.

964
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:12,424
I'm not walking
over there.

965
00:58:12,425 --> 00:58:13,636
What if someone's hurt?

966
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:15,373
If they're still alive,

967
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,323
they're doing a lot better
than some people we know.

968
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:20,222
We just can't leave
someone out here to die.

969
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:21,475
Look who grew a conscience.

970
00:58:21,477 --> 00:58:23,819
Look, they might need help.

971
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,910
Why me?

972
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,727
Because you have
a flashlight.

973
00:58:31,577 --> 00:58:33,960
Fine. I get it.

974
00:58:33,962 --> 00:58:35,576
I see how it is.

975
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,556
Let the brotha do it, huh?

976
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:39,819
I'm a man.

977
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,718
I'll walk over here.

978
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:45,273
I'm the man of the group
anyway, because I whooped you.

979
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:47,455
All right.

980
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,759
Oh, shit! Oh!

981
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,355
Don't touch me, man!

982
00:58:53,356 --> 00:58:55,982
Damn. All right.

983
00:58:57,518 --> 00:58:59,537
See if it's a little
baby in there.

984
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,880
Hey, baby.

985
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,658
You up in here?

986
00:59:07,983 --> 00:59:09,840
Oh, man, it's just a stup-

987
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,548
Ahh!

988
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:35,013
Oh, my God!

989
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:35,862
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

990
00:59:41,762 --> 00:59:42,691
Give me-

991
00:59:44,307 --> 00:59:44,953
No...

992
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:55,095
No! Please!

993
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:56,872
Wait, wait. No.
No, wait, wait, wait-

994
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:01,358
Die, you motherfucker!

995
01:00:22,612 --> 01:00:25,722
Raahr!

996
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,136
Aah!

997
01:00:39,543 --> 01:00:40,187
No!

998
01:00:40,188 --> 01:00:41,359
Ow! Shit! Ow!

999
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:45,803
I think we're losing him.

1000
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:46,894
- Ow! Hold on!
- No-

1001
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:48,390
I can't run!

1002
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,572
- You have to!
- What are you doing? Come on!

1003
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:51,905
Shut up,
you redneck twat!

1004
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,167
Uh!

1005
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:03,825
You... hit me!

1006
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,441
Yeah, and if you
don't shut up,

1007
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:07,057
I'm going to kick
your teeth out.

1008
01:01:07,058 --> 01:01:10,572
You cruel, stupid, slutty-

1009
01:01:10,574 --> 01:01:13,764
Guys, we don't
have time for this!

1010
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,744
I just want to make it stop.

1011
01:01:15,746 --> 01:01:17,441
Please, I just want
to wake up.

1012
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:19,057
We have to keep moving
away from that house.

1013
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:20,916
It don't matter.

1014
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:22,735
This is his swamp.

1015
01:01:22,736 --> 01:01:24,190
He's just going
to kill us all.

1016
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:26,249
There's gotta be something
that we can do.

1017
01:01:26,251 --> 01:01:28,553
He is trapped in the night
that he was killed.

1018
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,816
He's angry,
and he is scared.

1019
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:32,715
He's gonna mutilate
anyone that comes near him.

1020
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:35,422
What if he's human?
What if he never really died?

1021
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:37,603
That thing
was never human.

1022
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:39,745
Oh, shit.

1023
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:41,928
Guys, battery's not
gonna last much longer.

1024
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:43,584
All right.
Let's go, let's go!

1025
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:45,927
- Which way?
- Um...

1026
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:47,544
- That way.
- Raahr!

1027
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:50,453
Uhh!

1028
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:03,342
Stop! Stop, guys!

1029
01:02:03,343 --> 01:02:04,717
Guys, stop!

1030
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,433
This is useless.

1031
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:09,645
He's just going
to keep coming for us

1032
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:10,615
until we're all dead.

1033
01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:11,827
We can't stop running.

1034
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,403
What else
are we going to do?

1035
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:16,029
We can hurt him,
ghost or not.

1036
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:17,646
Look, you saw
how fast he fell

1037
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,303
when I stuck him
back there.

1038
01:02:19,304 --> 01:02:21,808
He went down
when you shot him.

1039
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,344
I'm saying we fight back.

1040
01:02:23,345 --> 01:02:25,566
How?

1041
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,383
Missy, you got
that lighter on you?

1042
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:29,605
Oh, you want to fight
that monster with my lighter?

1043
01:02:29,607 --> 01:02:32,839
Look, there were some
gas canisters back at the shed.

1044
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,889
Were they full?

1045
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,596
I don't know.
Maybe.

1046
01:02:36,598 --> 01:02:38,576
Wait, you want to go
back to the shed?

1047
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:41,041
I thought the further we got
from the house, the safer we get.

1048
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:43,465
If we don't kill him,
he'll kill us all.

1049
01:02:43,466 --> 01:02:45,324
You're crazy!

1050
01:02:45,325 --> 01:02:47,101
Man, you don't even know
if there's gas in those cans.

1051
01:02:47,103 --> 01:02:49,122
I know it's a better
chance than we have

1052
01:02:49,124 --> 01:02:51,506
running around in these woods,
getting picked off one by one.

1053
01:02:51,507 --> 01:02:52,799
No, you're right.

1054
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,849
Everything is soaked.

1055
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,425
How are we going
to start a fire?

1056
01:02:55,427 --> 01:02:56,759
If one of us
can get close enough

1057
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,930
to throw that gas
on him...

1058
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:59,628
We can light him up.

1059
01:02:59,629 --> 01:03:01,042
You're all high.

1060
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,294
No way.
I am not-

1061
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:03,425
Do you have a better idea?

1062
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,002
No.

1063
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:07,506
All right,
let's do this.

1064
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:08,395
How?

1065
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:24,315
Hurry.

1066
01:03:24,317 --> 01:03:26,780
Hey, buy me some time
in here, all right?

1067
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,134
Yell if you hear anything.

1068
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:43,347
- Ugh.
- Okay.

1069
01:03:43,348 --> 01:03:45,851
- Okay.
- Okay.

1070
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:47,952
Ooh.

1071
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:07,751
You see anything?

1072
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:09,044
Nuh-uh.

1073
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:13,368
Ah!

1074
01:04:18,056 --> 01:04:19,631
I'm okay!

1075
01:04:21,975 --> 01:04:24,237
Oh, shit.

1076
01:04:26,218 --> 01:04:28,479
I don't like this.

1077
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,933
It's too quiet.

1078
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:31,671
All right, come on.
Let's distract him.

1079
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:32,925
Hey, asshole!

1080
01:04:32,926 --> 01:04:34,581
Come out!
We're right here!

1081
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:35,914
Yeah, come out
and get us, Crowley!

1082
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,369
Where are you?

1083
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,228
Come on, you freak!

1084
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:41,005
You look like you've
been molested by wolves!

1085
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:45,086
Show yourself,
you ugly bastard!

1086
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,339
Come and get me, Crowley!

1087
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,520
What? You afraid I'm gonna
whip your ass again,

1088
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:53,611
you little bitch?

1089
01:05:02,018 --> 01:05:03,229
All right, come on!

1090
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,965
One on one!
Me and you!

1091
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:06,986
I'll put my foot
so far in your ass

1092
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:09,290
you're gonna be pulling shoelaces
out your teeth for a week!

1093
01:05:18,705 --> 01:05:20,199
You see anything?

1094
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,653
Nothing.

1095
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:27,270
Oh, shit.

1096
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:28,361
- Ben, get outta there!
- Ben!

1097
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:29,775
Hurry up! Get out!

1098
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:31,310
Ack!

1099
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:32,805
Ah! Oof!

1100
01:05:35,028 --> 01:05:38,543
- Raahr!
- Aah!

1101
01:05:38,544 --> 01:05:39,310
Uh!

1102
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:07,837
Yes! Burn, bitch!

1103
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:28,605
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

1104
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,545
Now what?
- No, just come on. Let's just go.

1105
01:06:35,718 --> 01:06:36,727
Ben.

1106
01:06:36,728 --> 01:06:39,514
Ben, you-
Hey, look at me!

1107
01:06:39,516 --> 01:06:41,414
All this bought us is time.
Don't waste it.

1108
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:41,899
Come on.

1109
01:07:25,498 --> 01:07:27,072
This way.

1110
01:07:27,073 --> 01:07:28,810
There's gotta be a path
that leads into the cemetery.

1111
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,295
Shit.

1112
01:07:37,296 --> 01:07:39,477
- This is shit, man.
- Shit.

1113
01:07:41,094 --> 01:07:42,346
Over here.

1114
01:07:50,912 --> 01:07:52,730
Oh, shit.

1115
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:57,579
All right, let's follow this
till we find an opening.

1116
01:08:07,156 --> 01:08:08,246
There it is.

1117
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:09,417
Thank God.

1118
01:08:28,086 --> 01:08:29,903
He's gonna kill me! Go!

1119
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:35,640
There's a gate!

1120
01:08:48,168 --> 01:08:49,339
Oh, shit!

1121
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:56,368
Oh! He got me!

1122
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:59,036
Ow! Guys...

1123
01:08:59,037 --> 01:09:00,248
You guys are gonna
break me in half!

1124
01:09:18,432 --> 01:09:19,925
That was the only gate.

1125
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:20,976
Aw, damn, man!

1126
01:09:20,977 --> 01:09:22,714
It's back into the woods.

1127
01:09:22,715 --> 01:09:23,926
No!

1128
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:30,876
Run!

1129
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:32,491
- No!
- Run!

1130
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,572
Ow! Oh!

1131
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:38,633
Uh! Oh... shit!

1132
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:52,735
Come on.

1133
01:09:52,736 --> 01:09:55,159
Raahr!

1134
01:10:07,363 --> 01:10:09,584
Holy shit! Ow!

1135
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:11,524
Come on.

1136
01:10:13,262 --> 01:10:14,393
No, come-

1137
01:10:15,404 --> 01:10:18,432
No!

1138
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:20,615
Mar-

1139
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,686
Marcus!

1140
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:26,150
I can't-
I can't go any further.

1141
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:28,413
Yes, you can!

1142
01:10:28,414 --> 01:10:30,151
Come on!

1143
01:10:30,152 --> 01:10:30,837
I think I hear the river!

1144
01:10:30,839 --> 01:10:32,090
Please.

1145
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:33,343
- Come on.
- No.

1146
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:35,121
We're not going
to die out here, okay?

1147
01:10:35,122 --> 01:10:36,413
Come on!

1148
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:54,232
No! No!

1149
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:55,889
You'll get eaten alive
in there.

1150
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,505
Then where do we go?

1151
01:10:57,506 --> 01:10:59,202
Aah!

1152
01:11:00,577 --> 01:11:02,152
Raahr!

1153
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:06,879
Get away!

1154
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,051
Push against the pole-
Ahh!

1155
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:10,111
Push against the pole
with your knees!

1156
01:11:47,366 --> 01:11:49,426
Come on.

1157
01:11:51,326 --> 01:11:52,779
Ah.

1158
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,689
I got you. I got you.

1159
01:12:15,691 --> 01:12:17,306
Okay. Okay, okay.

1160
01:12:21,388 --> 01:12:23,569
That's my daddy's boat.

1161
01:12:25,227 --> 01:12:26,963
Come on. Come on.

1162
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:08,622
Here.

1163
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:13,308
Use this.

1164
01:13:26,038 --> 01:13:28,663
Hey. Hey.

1165
01:13:28,664 --> 01:13:31,248
Thanks...

1166
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,309
for sticking with me
back there..

1167
01:13:37,594 --> 01:13:39,773
No.

1168
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,421
My daddy.

1169
01:13:48,059 --> 01:13:49,754
And Ainsley.

1170
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:55,087
Listen.

1171
01:13:57,715 --> 01:13:59,047
We're alive.

1172
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:03,492
We made it.

1173
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:07,532
I know.

1174
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:09,189
Raah!

1175
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:16,301
No!

1176
01:14:16,302 --> 01:14:16,866
Marybeth!

1177
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,150
Marybeth!

1178
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:03,535
Raahr!

1179
